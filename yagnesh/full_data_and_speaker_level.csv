Did the government make a mistake in moving -- moving for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of jurisdiction, as opposed to for judgment on the pleadings or just -- I -- I know -- I know they also moved for summary judgment, but why even have the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in there? And I'll tell you the reason why I'm asking is it seems to me that 1346(c) gives district courts the jurisdiction to resolve civil actions against the government on the bases that's listed in the statute. And it seems to me that that means that the government is submitting as sovereign to the district court's resolution of those claims either way, whether they win or not, so it's different than, say, in Simmons, where the district court does not have jurisdiction to resolve claims if they involve misconduct in the exercise of a discretionary function.

28,28,3188.69,3259.885,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Jaicomo. I want to raise the point that's bothering me about what we should decide, and I don't blame you for raising the alternative argument. I understand that. You're trying to win the case. But trying to think about why we should consider it. We obviously discuss very carefully our decisions to grant certiorari on particular cases and particular issues within that case, and we don't usually decide things that weren't decided by the court below. And there are exceptions to that, and no doubt about that, and you -- but I don't think this is embedded within in the way you said. And sometimes we'll do it if it's really -- really simple and it will be helpful just to go ahead and resolve it. But I'm not sure this qualifies as really simple either because, if we get to the merits -- at least not very simple in your direction because, if we get to the merits of that alternative argument, every court of appeals, save one, has ruled against you, and the text says ""any action,"" not any subsequent action. You have forceful arguments in response to that, but I guess I'm just back at why should we consider that issue at this time in this case, given the way it was developed in the Sixth Circuit?",19-546.wav,167,71.19500000000016,51019040,52158160,225,3.160334293138556,0.002129677419515,7.428855096719489,0.1856252535169394,7.123026380191326,7.314693046857993,7.414693046857993,7.548026380191326,7.811193046857993,125.0,1.7557412739658644,-2.09855361864231,0.5661935483870968,0.2631378980228933,-20.27602233684575,0.6816090941429138,41.785141843439725,27.194327673971948,150.39492753623188,105.21289158651008,3.6720848504363617,0.9250921849183092,0.28827283278167437,0.0885866980349623,0.08267825216654537,0.05598365733477938,7.302647592312538,0.09655138904451238,7.131531228676175,0.1642337783726713,7.404602137767084,0.10076849787715361,7.537746077161023,0.145950966081457,8.134930016554963,0.4566865213451057,0.0025722081712864233,0.001067457467631925,7.447458978103783,0.11757742611642309,0.23515437131928815,0.093778177989873,106.37943262411348,70.00860142144354,2.6024435303402793,0.4200907396457913,-0.15217291260408963,0.6377656946574696

You suggest that there can really be no reliance because people, especially sophisticated parties, as Justice Gorsuch suggests, are -- are doing their own investigation of the patent's validity. Is there any reason why the reliance incurred or why there would be reliance by the parties who are the assignees that could hurt them?

54,22,2859.42,2962.995,Neil_Gorsuch,scotus_justice,"Ms. Ratner, as I understand it, no court's ever applied the version of estoppel that you're proposing now. And so I -- I guess my first question is, why doesn't it face the same stare decisis challenges that the Petitioner has? So that's one set of questions for you. Second is, with respect to the -- the choice of relying on estoppel by deed and the analogy to physical property, it allows -- your test would allow liability even when there's no misrepresentation of fact and the buyer, often in these cases large and sophisticated, more so than the seller, could easily determine the validity of the patent on its own and is better positioned to do so. And you also get rid of reliance. And I guess I don't understand why we would impose liability on statements that even you'd agree were utterly meaningless at the time.

It seems to me that your approach doesn't give us the efficiency of -- of estoppel doctrines generally. I mean, think about Blonder Tongue, patent context, and, you know, estoppel there, issue -- issue preclusion shuts it down and makes litigation more efficient.

67,35,4487.02,4554.975,Neil_Gorsuch,scotus_justice,"So, counsel, on the stare decisis front, I think I heard the SG's office acknowledge we're somewhere in between things. And as I come at it -- and tell me what's wrong with this -- Westinghouse didn't actually apply the doctrine. It acknowledged its existence and allowed the challenges over the scope of the -- of the patent. Scott Paper called it a logical embarrassment. Lear said that Scott had undermined the basis for patent estoppel even more than Westinghouse had. So it read Westinghouse as undermining the basis for patent estoppel. The world has changed greatly since then, as Justice Breyer pointed out, in terms of employee/employer relations and how these contracts of adhesions are often used against employees. And now we have the Patent Office itself refusing to apply patent estoppel in its own proceedings, for -- in IPR proceedings. So the only place left that this doctrine seems to apply is in court.

104,30,2663.52,2795.88,Sonia_Sotomayor,scotus_justice,"Counsel, your last answer troubles me because there are three rights at issue here that I see, at least three. It's your right, your client's right as an Independent to seek judicial appointment, and that right is being limited by this majority party rule. Then there's the governor's right under Elrod and Branti to decide who he wants to appoint to a certain position, and he could, maybe not this governor, but another governor might want an Independent or another third-party applicant, but the constitution stops him from doing that. And that's where I think Elrod and Branti would have quite a -- a lot to say about whether or not your political affiliations have much to do with your decision-making. And -- and that, I think, would be what we would have to face given Justice Alito's question, a governor who says, I won't appoint somebody from another party under any circumstance. But that's not the case here. The case here involves the State, and it's the State's choice for its own interests balancing partisanship and promoting an independent judiciary who says, I want to prohibit both your client and the State and the governor from acting in a particular way, i.e. from selecting you merely because you're an Independent. And it seems to me that the bare majority rule, that or prohibition in this case, is more than adequate to take care of those two interests, but the majority party rule doesn't -- isn't. But you're arguing against both.

I know that this baseball bat is likely to slip out of my hands and bump somebody on the head. There's a person standing in front of me. I think: Oh, God, that person may be hit. I don't want him to, but he might be because I'm so bad. And then I swing it, and he's hit. All right.

155,24,2481.35,2580.56,Stephen_G_Breyer,scotus_justice,"In going back to the statute itself, what it does is it takes, say, possession of a firearm or ammunition, which is illegal, and it changes the sentence from no minimum up to 10 years to a 15-year minimum sentence up to life, and that happens where you have three prior crimes that fit the definition. That's a pretty serious consequence. So this Court, I think, has struggled to try to make sure the really bad things are in those three priors and not things that are not quite so bad. So that's why I find Leocal and Begay pretty much on point. Now Begay, we had drunk driving. And dozens -- quite a few states make drunk driving -- they put in that recklessness. All right. We had it and we said in the residual clause, you have to have -- the -- the residual clause is closer to what you want, and it talks about a serious potential risk of physical injury.

And, further, I mean, Voisine spends as -- as much time talking about the effects of coming out the other way than it does about the text.

165,34,3707.54,3801.335,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Exactly. Well, so -- so I'm sorry to interrupt, but the -- the point being that Leocal recognizes the distinction that's traditional: Negligence, out; recklessness and above, per model penal code, is usually considered more important. But you don't have to guess because you have Voisine, I guess, that draws that distinction. And so that's what I thought the distinction was between Leocal and Voisine, but -- as your brief said. The other thing I wanted to get to is the notice point has been raised here. And it seems to me that the notice in this kind of statute is a little bit different, but -- and this is more of a comment, and you can fill in the gaps of it. But we're not talking about notice for committing reckless assault under Tennessee law. What we're talking about is someone who's been convicted three times for separate offenses under Tennessee law, or other state law, who then, after being convicted of three violent felonies, knowing they shouldn't possess firearms, nonetheless possesses firearms on notice they shouldn't possess firearms because they've been convicted of these prior offenses. So you actually have to four times have committed some pretty significant violation before you fall into this statute.

And, here, it seems to me that inherent in a detention-and-hold right is the right to investigation. The Ninth Circuit basically said that they can investigate to find out if someone's an Indian or not. And if they're an Indian, presumably, they would have all the rights of further investigation.

182,14,1373.55,1444.13,Neil_Gorsuch,scotus_justice,"Good morning, counsel. I -- I -- I guess I would have approached this thinking that tribal sovereignty remains until and unless Congress has withdrawn it in some fashion and that the relevant question here is, what -- what does the Major Crimes Act do to Indian sovereignty? And, there, it's clear that Congress has withdrawn jurisdiction to try certain non-native people in certain locations within Indian country. Fine. My question approaching it that way, Mr. Feigin, is, where is the line?

201,33,3467.395,3575.78,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Henkel. You make what I think are forceful separation-of-powers arguments, particularly that Congress has provided for cross-deputization, and that was not taken advantage of here. So I take that point, and that's an important one for me. But, at the same time, a couple other thoughts that I'll throw out there, and then you can react to them. The amicus brief from the former U.S. Attorneys says that ""criminal jurisdiction in Indian country is an indefensible morass of complex, conflicting, and illogical commands layered in over decades via congressional policies and court decisions and without the consent of tribal nations."" And I don't think you're going to disagree with that description necessarily, and so that leads me to think that one of the things we should be trying to do here is -- is to do no harm because there's lots of ripple effects from a broad decision. And with that in mind, there are statements in our decisions in Duro and Strate that really cut directly against you, as you're -- you're well aware. And you can say those are dicta, and that might be correct, but those have guided the law -- law enforcement for several decades. I think Congress and the executive could reasonably rely on those statements in the Court's decision. Certainly, the Cohen treatise treats those statements as authoritative in terms of guidance. So why isn't the best thing we can do here just to stick with what we said in those cases? It's not very analytically satisfying, but it's a narrow result. It does not make a morass, as it was described, any worse.

I mean, on the one hand, as Justice Kavanaugh points out, it's not very analytically satisfying to rely on the dicta, particularly from the footnote in Strate. But I want to try this on -- you know, you say one problem with our -- you know, or the government's approach or an approach saying that there is some sort of retained authority to police here is that we haven't identified its scope or its source. But, you know, Montana and those cases that followed it relied pretty heavily on the unfairness of imposing tribal law on those who didn't participate in its creation. And in that respect, Strate's footnote is perfectly consistent with that because, as the United States pointed out in argument and in its brief, you know, Cooley and -- and other non-members of the tribe are represented in the creation of federal law. And so it doesn't pose that same problem here. It's -- it's far less of an unfairness, and Strate's footnote can be seen to be consistent with that principle, particularly if the United States is right that one way to understand Montana is that that is an instance of implied preemption that cashes out when you consider the assertion of authority to adjudicate finally civil or criminal liability or the imposition of regulations on those who didn't participate in its exercise.

228,23,3622.685,3782.9,Stephen_G_Breyer,scotus_justice,"Yeah. Thank you. Go back for a minute to the late 1940s, early 1950s. Most of the natural gas was in the Permian Basin in Oklahoma and in Texas, and they were on the verge of or had built pipelines to carry that natural gas to California, San Diego, El Paso Natural Gas, or up to Pennsylvania, over to Illinois, up to Massachusetts. A lot of the states -- not a lot, but some were objecting in a whole variety of complex ways. And so Congress passed the Natural Gas Act. Now they couldn't have built the pipelines unless they had this power, I think, I'm not certain of that, but I don't see how they could have because they need -- go look at the map on the -- the map of waterways in which Pennsylvania claims an interest in the Marcellus Shale Coalition. They zone water beds. They own all kinds of obstacles. But this was passed to build a pipeline. How could they have done it? I don't see it. And having known a little bit about that, since you need the federal power or a government power to -- for a private person to use eminent domain for anything against a private land or by a state, I don't understand how they would have -- how any reasonable person would have delegated any eminent-domain power to the Natural Gas Act, which was for interstate pipelines, without including the power to proceed against the state. Am I right about that? And, if I am right and, therefore, it is clearly in this statute, why in heaven's name can't the Federal Power Commission then, or FERC now, have done the same thing? And if they could have done the same thing under law of Congress, why can't they hire somebody, just as Mississippi hires private prosecutors sometimes in criminal cases? Or there are dozens of examples where private persons are delegated under supervision, and, here, the supervision is close, to go and do something that the public can do by bringing a criminal case, et cetera, et cetera. Do you see the thrust of my argument? Very historical.

We've made a firm distinction between specific and general jurisdiction for many years. We say specific jurisdiction has to ""arise out of."" Everybody seems to know what that means. Nobody knows what ""relates to"" means, the other part of the test. And so I -- I guess -- I guess I want to take you back to first principles along the lines of Justice Thomas. What does due process require? I suppose one could say it's whatever fair play -- whatever we think fair play means, in which case you -- you might run into some of the troubles we've -- we've been hearing some of the questions about. But it could mean -- due process could mean a couple of other things. One, it could mean the law of the land. Are you being haled into court in accordance with the law of the land? And, surely, that -- that's met here, the state long-arm statute. No one contests that it reaches you. Or it might mean that, as originally understood, the Due Process Clause and the ideas behind the due process would not have allowed a defendant to be haled into court in these kinds of circumstances.

I think the Chief Justice and others have pointed out the difficulty of our purposeful availment test in an Internet age, and some of it was cabined by a rise out of when that had some causal link, but now we're blowing past that and we're adorning ""relate to"" to mean something more, which I -- I totally understand. And I get your same product test is a limiting way, though I think there -- there are issues there. What if, for example, Ford didn't sell Explorers in Montana, but the part that allegedly failed in the Explorer by your client in Montana is also sold by Ford in lots of other models in Montana? Which is the relevant product? Is it the Explorer or is it the part? And -- and I -- I foresee a lot of difficulties there, all of which, again, takes me back to, at least -- at least me, to these first principle questions. We seem to be blurring the line between specific and general jurisdiction.

You have the text that you assert, your reading of the text in -- in Yamaha obviously helps you, but there are also problems. One is the inequity between defendants, one of whom tacks on 1442 and therefore gets appellate review, the other of whom doesn't have the ability to tack on 1442 and doesn't get appellate review even though they have the same other attempted federal question ground. So that -- that's one problem, which makes it seem -- seem doubtful that Congress really intended this. There's also the gamesmanship problem. And then there's the ratification, which I want to zero in on with you. What exactly would you say about the ratification doctrine?

I -- I -- I see the linguistic argument, which is tough for you, but I see the argument from -- that's order, and the argument from Yamaha, you have to overcome those. I'm not focusing on those. I want to focus on a problem that occurred to me. It's in every legal system. It's important to have an appeal. It's -- it's unfair not to give people appeals. But, if you give them appeals in the middle of the case, too often you will really muck up the system, take too long. And so we allow some things to go ahead even though there was no appeal and it might be unfair and wrong because we don't want to muck up the system. That's what I see underlying this statute since 1887. You know? No, no appeal. But now they have an appeal on some things. So you're not going to waste a lot of time; it's in the court of appeals anyway. You'll waste some time if you let them have other things. But the big waste, the big time-consuming thing, is getting the appeal in the first place. Now it's here. So we've undercut the main reason for not giving people an appeal. We've undercut it, not destroyed it. Now, if that's correct policy, then that's on the other side that you're trying to argue.

325,8,646.88,751.72,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr,scotus_justice,"Mr. Fisher, let me try out this argument which supports your position, and the argument very simply is that hot pursuit has to be hot and it has to be a pursuit. It has to -- it has to involve a chase. The person, the arrestee, must actually be trying to flee and avoid arrest, and that makes it -- it -- there are justifications for such a doctrine because, when an arrestee is chased and flees into his house, there are strong reasons across the board for not waiting for a warrant. There's a heightened risk that this person is going to sneak away before the house can be surrounded. One of the briefs says it takes six to eight officers to surround the house waiting for a warrant. There's a heightened risk that evidence is going to be destroyed, a heightened risk that the person is going to barricade himself in the house, get a gun, and resist the execution of a warrant. Here, the -- the video shows there was no chase and Mr. Lange really didn't flee, and all that the court below held was that a reasonable person in his position would have known that the officer was trying to stop him. That -- after viewing the video, even that seems to me dubious. And if you take into account Mr. Lange's blood alcohol content, it's even more questionable. But, if we hold that hot pursuit requires a hot pursuit, won't we go a long way toward preventing warrantless arrests for minor infractions and therefore deal with the serious problems that you raise in your brief?",20-18.wav,33,104.84000000000005,10350080,12027520,271,2.584891262876764,0.0046630596937693,7.521885650124083,0.3500225845369443,7.038526380191327,7.33135971352466,7.431359713524659,7.63135971352466,8.745526380191327,214.0,2.041205646699732,-1.6723825042294658,0.4876619718309859,0.1461136885538581,-23.73400014905698,0.8241459131240845,35.177049469081275,18.167109216140013,95.2690909090909,45.71811789558996,2.7815072068155478,0.6326351832644984,0.36861430167853837,0.08379884919153073,0.11033019250911293,0.0543963935874066,7.187024251237555,0.14144256594555582,6.97135484734461,0.16710109796171438,7.3548238254468,0.17424392059415778,7.600330212308115,0.2547982108901217,8.401194263403005,0.42156010250370535,0.0043786502521027506,0.001931427510143299,7.440229568872157,0.17357454826065932,0.36484100882161585,0.11326622023216541,83.12014134275618,41.37580387230249,2.422595359426968,0.41004469303672064,-0.2356690736602689,0.7367765817651246

345,28,2587.28,2712.64,Sonia_Sotomayor,scotus_justice,"Counsel, I've been listening to the exchange with my colleagues involving the difficulty in deciding what's a felony and what's a misdemeanor. Part of the problem is that what are felonies are no longer absolutely, necessarily, and in all situations dangerous crimes. You can have white-collar crimes where there is no danger. You can have all sorts of environmental crimes, other things that don't cause -- that don't create exigency in the same sense that Santana was announcing the rule or that the common law came from. And so I don't know why anybody is arguing that there's a difference between felony and misdemeanors and why we're recognizing a categorical rule at all. Why isn't the better reading just that hot pursuit is a type of exigent circumstance that can but does not always justify warrantless entry, regardless of whether the underlying offense is a felony or misdemeanor?

First, Justice Breyer points out that different states have different rules about what a felony is and what a misdemeanor is, and it would seem odd that the Constitution would -- in its meaning, would depend upon the happenstance of positive state law. And, second, we live in a world in which everything has been criminalized. And some professors have even opined that there's not an American alive who hasn't committed a felony in some -- under some state law. And in a world like that, why does it make sense to retreat back to the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment, which I'm going to oversimplify but generally says that you get to go into a home without a warrant if the officer sees a -- a -- a violent action or something that's likely to be -- lead to imminent violence?

Why don't we just adopt the exception without reference to labels like felony or misdemeanor but go back to whether or not the protection was necessary and the crime reflected the issues that the common law thought important to justify warrantless entry?",20-18.wav,218,99.48000000000047,67424640,69016320,183,1.839565741857651,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.4398953914642334,44.46467532370128,29.323536082635478,109.95065789473684,64.76436751714465,2.6200657466040966,0.5723811233062479,0.38986261995261484,0.08549628047217346,0.14846682776161488,0.0746770811751684,7.805133013963255,0.0884566789404497,7.52516015212115,0.11428521109671706,7.961307630191326,0.08851800305022046,8.1460801082615,0.0987287036854877,8.61493043720887,0.15558226283182808,0.0053205713258318785,0.0012754877286273074,7.989100632851335,0.08388340704942504,0.2658622875682973,0.037591125014008825,93.28246753246754,53.59622310714378,2.2051424364380097,0.34059064244110976,-0.024018506203511997,0.6771992073311195

371,54,4800.8,4866.56,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Ms. Rice. First, I want to explore how much is really at stake or how much of a difference there would be between the two positions here for officers on the ground in the wake of our decision. So I understand your position to be that there should be a rule, a categorical rule, and it seems to me the reason to have a categorical rule is because often, if not always, there will be some kind of exigency involved when you had a how -- a hot pursuit, destruction of evidence, danger to others, escape of the suspect. I guess that cuts both ways, though, because one could say, well, you don't need a categorical rule because you already have the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine that covers all the things that justify the categorical rule. So I guess I'm wondering what the real difference in practice would be between a world where we have a categorical rule and a world where we allow all the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine cases to apply as they exist now.",20-18.wav,246,65.76000000000022,76812800,77864960,181,2.7524330900243217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.6008188128471375,41.785141843439725,27.194327673971948,150.39492753623188,105.21289158651008,3.6720848504363617,0.9250921849183092,0.28827283278167437,0.0885866980349623,0.08267825216654537,0.05598365733477938,7.302647592312538,0.09655138904451238,7.131531228676175,0.1642337783726713,7.404602137767084,0.10076849787715361,7.537746077161023,0.145950966081457,8.134930016554963,0.4566865213451057,0.0025722081712864233,0.001067457467631925,7.447458978103783,0.11757742611642309,0.23515437131928815,0.093778177989873,106.37943262411348,70.00860142144354,2.6024435303402793,0.4200907396457913,-0.15217291260408963,0.6377656946574696

It seems to me that's a different kind of term than ""search"" or ""seizure"" or ""cruel and unusual,"" and ""unreasonable"" means unreasonable. So what we're really talking about is not original meaning or original intent or even original expected application because I don't -- I'm not aware of anyone in the first Congress or in the state ratifying processes that said ""unreasonable"" means the common law, unlike -- and the text is unlike the Seventh Amendment, which refers to the common law expressly. And Professor Lafave and others have pointed this out. So it's not really original meaning or even original intent. It's more like presumed original expected applications, like a Justice Douglas-style interpretation. No offense to Justice Douglas, but a little more free-form than what we usually talk about when we talk about original meaning.

But I wonder if the exigent circumstances doctrine, in other words, the first option, really wouldn't provide, you know, not as clear a rule but still a pretty clear rule for officers because the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine really, as I see it, tracks common sense, these are the kinds of cases and the kinds of reasons an officer would do this in the first place, want to go into the house without a warrant, especially escape of the suspect, threats to others, destruction of evidence. So I guess I'm not sure what's gained by a categorical rule.

Why do we take -- and as we've pointed out again and again and again, today, the line between felonies and misdemeanors can seem quite arbitrary -- so why would we pull out as the key fact something's designation as a felony? Why wouldn't we simply say, okay, for the very serious crimes that used to be felonies at common law, then this rule applies, but otherwise the felony/misdemeanor line doesn't really have much significance here?

And two things the Court has often looked to in applying that to state laws, say, in the free speech context and others is, one, whether the right -- the exception is historically recognized, that a right has coexisted with an exception of some kind historically, and the second thing, this -- the Court's often looked at, not exclusively, but has looked at, is how many states have also shared this same interest.

You cannot. It doesn't say if it does those things you can punish it. It says you can't unless. And the issue here seems, does that apply off campus? Why not? After all, if I look at the case here in the record, is there in the record something that shows that what this young woman did -- I mean, she used swear words, you know, unattractive swear words, off campus. Did that cause a material and substantial disruption? I don't see much evidence it did.

And what you say is -- and the Solicitor General makes a similar argument -- it matters whether the speech targets the school. I have no idea what it means to target the school. Now let me give you an example to make this more concrete, and since Tinker occurred back during the Vietnam War, it -- it -- it will relate to that. So, during the war, a student says, war is immoral, American soldiers are baby killers, I hope there are a lot of casualties so that people will rise up.

474,17,1585.0,1685.28,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Ms. Blatt. I want to focus on the facts of this case a bit and -- and my reaction to it. As you say and I think helpful for you, the context here is a team and a coach, not the school more generally. But, as a judge and maybe as a coach and a parent too, it seems like maybe a bit of over -- overreaction by the coach. So my reaction when I read this, she's competitive, she cares, she blew off steam like millions of other kids have when they're disappointed about being cut from the high school team or not being in the starting lineup or not making all league. And just by way of comparison about -- and to show how much it means to people, you know, arguably, the greatest basketball player of all time is inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009 and gives a speech, and what does he talk about? He talks about getting cut as a sophomore from the varsity team. And he wasn't joking. He was critical 30 years later. It still -- it still bothered him. And I think that's just emblematic of how much it means to kids to make a high school team. It is so important to their lives, and coaches sweat the cuts, and it guts coaches to have to cut a kid who's on the bubble, and -- and good coaches understand the importance and they understand the emotions. So maybe what bothers me when I read all this is that it didn't seem like the punishment was tailored to the offense given what I just said about how important it is and you know how much it means to the kids. I mean, a year's suspension from the team just seems excessive to me.

477,20,1773.16,1834.68,Amy_Coney_Barrett,scotus_justice,"Good morning, Ms. Blatt. So let me -- let -- let's assume that I think about the case in the following way, you know, that high school students enjoy the same free speech rights as everyone else. Tinker acknowledged that in the context of the -- once you cross the schoolhouse gate, those rights are somewhat reduced because of the school environment and the need to, you know, control and avoid substantial disruption, but they're not lost altogether, but that nothing in Tinker suggests itself that it applies outside of the school environment. And so what you're asking us to do is to extend the school's authority that Tinker acknowledges outside of the school environment. And I think you have good policy reasons for doing that.

But your three-part test certainly has its own issues. You know, it's not going to be easy to apply, and I think a lot of the questions that you've gotten today show a concern, including in this case, that schools abuse this authority and that they punish things that maybe don't cause substantial disruption or political speech or religious speech that they shouldn't or -- you know, I think you've heard a lot of skepticism about whether the speech at issue in this case actually caused substantial disruption. So I -- I -- I -- I guess my concern is, if we have two -- two tests being offered or on offer, neither one is going to be easy to apply in all cases, they'll both have hard cases, which one ought we apply? Which one is the more protective of speech? And -- and let me ask you this: Insofar as the policy concerns go, nothing in the First Amendment prohibits soft discipline, right, like, in this case, the cheerleader coming to school and being told -- rather than being kicked off the team and punished, being told we're aware of the Snapchat, this is not good for team cohesion, this is not respectful of your coaches, if we see any of this kind of behavior on the field or at practice or undermining morale, there is going to be a consequence but not imposing one yet.

499,42,4210.08,4319.28,Stephen_G_Breyer,scotus_justice,"Thank you. The difficulty I have I've already mentioned. A few years ago, a superintendent of schools, I think in San Francisco, said, you know, schools have changed a lot, public schools, since when I went there. He said, today we don't just teach classical subjects. We're there to help the child have adequate health, in many cases, to see that he's adequately fed. In quite a few cases, we become a caretaker, and we don't want to send them home immediately because there's nobody home, and we have to plan after-school activities. There are dozens of areas that didn't used to be thought of as within the purview of the public school. Today, in many places, they are. Now add to that the Internet and the Internet not just listening to teachers but also doing homework and also writing papers, sometimes vaguely defined and sometimes and sometimes. How do I get a standard out of that? I'm frightened to death of writing a standard. And Tinker, after all, doesn't really write a standard. It just says you can't regulate school unless it substantially disrupts or hurts somebody else. It doesn't say if it does that you can do anything you want. You still must use some kind of test, like proportionality or something else, and I can mention that often outside of school it's the parents' job, not the teachers' if, by the way, there are parents in the house, et cetera, and I can mention the differences and say take those into account.

If we're going to address the broad issues, then I, for one, think we need clear rules that protect freedom of speech. On the other hand, if the Court, having decided to take this case, wants to decide it without addressing those broad issues, of course, the Court could dismiss the case, and I assume you wouldn't have an objection to that. But, if the Court doesn't do that, could the Court do something along these lines: Say Tinker applies in school. It says nothing one way or the other about what a school may or may not do to student speech outside the school. We look at the particular comments made here. They're made in colorful language, but, substantively, they boil down to something like, I have no respect for the school, I have no respect for the cheer squad, I hate the school, I hate the cheer squad, I also hate my private softball team.

The level at which speech has to arrive to meet those standards is very, very high, and I'm dubious that most of the conduct that teenagers engage in would fit any of our traditional categories. So let's talk about harassment, okay? A common episode, I think I read it in a newspaper, a young girl is subjected to -- each time she goes out of the house, whether she's in the playground, not the school playground, or walking to school with a group of classmates walking by and saying, you're so ugly, why are you even alive? That's not a true threat. They're not threatening her with any bodily harm. It is not harassment if that's all -- if they're just speaking.

One of your problems is that it's difficult to define the school environment and what constitutes the school environment. What would be wrong with saying that the school environment exists when the student is relating -- not just supervisory. I mean, that -- that's narrow. What about when the student is relating to the school in the student's capacity as a student?

519,62,6526.32,6692.32,John_G_Roberts_Jr,scotus_justice,"Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Ms. Blatt. MS. BLATT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. There's some sort of twilight zone going on when the head of the ACLU says that schools allow hecklers' veto, punishment for whistleblowing, any kind of reporting, any kind of criticism, all that matters is someone is offended. And you have the Biden administration and the school district saying that's not true. That's not what Tinker allows. Now Mr. Cole said the case law allows us to act like Soviets and the North -- North Koreans. But the -- since the Saxe opinion, the Morse concurrence, Fillmore and Zalon Acts have left clean -- clear lines for schools in that hecklers' vetoes are not allowed. And your choice is this: If you -- you could choose to either tighten Tinker or you can say, well, we're going to assume Tinker is out of control on campus, but we will leave open season on schools and complete chaos as to what their test allows. Under their view, all 50 states define bullying in terms of Tinker. You have the same e-mail chain that would toggle on and off campus and you would have the Tinker test applying when there's some on-campus speech, and I don't know what applies. I think Mr. Cole said it's the Tinker test, but he's afraid to use the Tinker word because it's scary, and it shouldn't be. You're much better off cleaning this doctrine up. Justice Kagan, you had amazing questions about school speech. Remember, our test is the audience has to be the school, so all of your speech, if it's to the press, the police, your pastor, your family, et cetera, none of that is school speech even if it involves a school topic. Justice Barrett, on threats, the facts in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Bell, nobody knew whether that was a threat. The police were sort of involved. It is not fair to the parents of those other kids to have schools fumbling around. Well, I don't know what this applies before we had Tinker, part of the threats were on campus, part were off, it was on the Internet. Let's look at where she drafted it, maybe she was to and from. Now let's move to the school supervision: madness, confusion, and chaos. Please don't do this to schools. Mr. Cole said you could prevent swearing to and from school. That's nuts. You're in the dad's minivan. That's school supervision under their view. No one thinks Fraser applied there, and yet all of a sudden, when you get out of the minivan and I guess walking to it, it maybe depends on how fair you park, Tinker is going in and out of coverage, that rule makes no sense. There's no case law on conduct that aids and abets school speech. You will have a school speech petition. You can keep denying cert, but I guarantee the courts are going to -- they're going to freak out when Tinker has been the law off campus for 20 years.

531,11,1044.04,1137.16,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Stewart. I'm not sure this wolf comes as a wolf, Mr. Stewart, but I still think it may be a wolf, as Justice Scalia famously said, and he said, in those cases, it can be discerned by careful and perceptive analysis. So here's why -- here -- here's the sources of my concern on that front. First, this structure is a real break from tradition, which we've said in cases like Free Enterprise Fund and many others, perhaps the most telling indication of a constitutional problem is the departure -- the lack of historical precedent. The lack of agency review of the ALJ decision by someone who's appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate is absent here and is ordinarily present and historically has been present. And then, second, the lack of accountability, as the Chief Justice said and Justice Gorsuch was just saying, these are multimillion, sometimes billion-dollar decisions being made not by someone who's accountable in the usual way that the Appointments Clause demands. And the director, on rehearing, does not have the unilateral power to reverse. So, you know, if Congress is going to do that, they can eliminate agency review and prevent removal at will, then it's easy to make these AL -- APJs presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed. They haven't done that.

He does not provide exemplary applications of patent law to fact patterns that are binding on APJs. He does not control whether a panel's decision will be precedential. He does not direct whether a panel's decision will be reheard by controlling whether a Precedential Opinion Panel on which he sits votes to rehear a case.

That, of course, is the critical line from Edmond about the administrative judge context. Just to pick up on Justice Gorsuch, this does seem, and I think you acknowledged, a -- a significant departure from general historical practice since the APA, which is a yellow flag, if not a red flag. And then your test to try to deal with that seems to resurrect Morrison v. Olson's test. I thought we'd gotten away from that in -- in Edmond. Justice Alito's questions pointed that out. And what I'm worried about -- this is the wolf. What I'm worried about is this gives a model for Congress to eliminate agency review of ALJ decisions and kind of fragment and take away from agency control going forward, because this -- however this came about, to Justice Kagan's question, this would be a model going forward, and that would allow Congress to give extraordinary power to inferior officers, which is not how our government is ordinarily structured. And then, to Justice Sotomayor's question, it seems like ALJs, there's two -- there's two fixes. You can go with the executive model of ALJs, which is the traditional have ALJs and have agency review or removability, it's usually agency review, not removability with ALJs; or you can make the APJs principal officers with presidential appointment and Senate advice and consent if you want a more judicial model.

So, you know, the federal -- well, think about -- one unusual thing about the remedy here is that it's not one specific provision in this statutory scheme that's being challenged as unconstitutional. It's the way that they work together. You know, so we could, if we decided that it was unconstitutional, perhaps make all of the APJs subject to -- say they're principal officers, and so they have to be subject to presidential appointment, senatorial confirmation. We could say, listen, we're going to strike the provision in the statute that says only the PTAB may grant rehearings so that the director has that authority. We could make them maybe at-will employees, so they're removable at the discretion of the director without having to go through the full process that we discussed before.

555,35,3708.48,3876.36,Sonia_Sotomayor,scotus_justice,"Counsel, I find it odd -- not odd to protect Congress's prerogative, but it's nothing that we do will tie Congress's hands. And one thing we do know is that they can change anything we do as a temporary remedy, assuming we were to rule in your favor. But I -- I have a problem with our jurisprudence as -- as it's developed in this -- in -- in these cases. And the founding generation conceived of principal officers as synonymous with heads of departments. In early debates and enactments that structured executive department, heads of the department were -- were referred to as principal officers and other members as inferior officers. There's a whole history that many of those inferior officers took final decisions in a wide variety of areas. Yet that's the way we proceeded. The history also shows that early statutes gave non-principal officers the power to make final adjudicatory decisions on behalf of the executive. Your opposing counsel pointed out that as early as 1793, non-principal officers were given the power to adjudicate patent disputes, and in 1803, land commissioners were given the power to make final determinations as to a claimant's right to a tract of land. I personally read this history as suggesting that principal officers were intended to be policymakers, and individuals who merely adjudicated claims based on said policies were not principal officers. So, for me, the person that has to be held responsible is not the individual ILJ -- or ALJ who is making a decision. It's the person who creates the policy. And for me, it's clear that APJs are not policymakers. All the policies are vested in the director. Precedential power is put in the director. The ALJs cannot influence the course of the law. That's only the director. So please tell me why the individual decision based on a quasi-law precedent and policy set by the director is a final decision that that director won't be held responsible for.",19-1434.wav,184,167.8800000000001,59335680,62021760,331,1.971646414105312,0.0062079184302241,7.951621863551074,0.2903778379606204,7.443526380191326,7.739693046857993,7.914693046857993,8.13135971352466,8.623026380191327,353.0,2.1026923993328555,-0.8643771777364441,0.4733636363636364,0.2090759586776862,-9.358366463423184,0.8309261202812195,44.46467532370128,29.323536082635478,109.95065789473684,64.76436751714465,2.6200657466040966,0.5723811233062479,0.38986261995261484,0.08549628047217346,0.14846682776161488,0.0746770811751684,7.805133013963255,0.0884566789404497,7.52516015212115,0.11428521109671706,7.961307630191326,0.08851800305022046,8.1460801082615,0.0987287036854877,8.61493043720887,0.15558226283182808,0.0053205713258318785,0.0012754877286273074,7.989100632851335,0.08388340704942504,0.2658622875682973,0.037591125014008825,93.28246753246754,53.59622310714378,2.2051424364380097,0.34059064244110976,-0.024018506203511997,0.6771992073311195

I want to follow up on some other of my colleagues' questions and then turn to severability. First, following up on the Chief's questions, my understanding of your position is that you take the position that ALJs within the Executive Branch may be somewhat of an uneasy constitutional solution, but it's historically settled, we have tenure protection, plus agency review, and that gives due process but also gives ultimate agency control of policy.

And that -- that leads to kind of an anomaly, I think we'd all agree, and I'm not sure I could understand the rational reason for the distinction, which makes me wonder what about 355(g), which, as you know, suggests that findings of fact and conclusions of law by the Board in their determination of claims are final and conclusive on all persons? And let -- you know, it makes me wonder whether Congress ever anticipated the idea of reopening decisions or even authorized them.

587,15,1584.35,1713.285,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Good morning, Ms. Harris. I want to pick up on something Justice Breyer brought up about the history of this issue and case law, because my understanding's very different from his, and I just wanted to get that out there, and you can respond. So here's my understanding of what's happened on this issue over the years: In 1966, Judge Friendly issued an opinion for the Second Circuit that said there was judicial review of these kinds of reopenings, and that's been the law in the Second Circuit for 54 years now. It's in a ""but see"" in the government's brief, but that's been the law in -- in the Second Circuit. Then along comes Califano in 1977, dealing, of course, with a different act with different language, and says no judicial review there. And then the courts of appeals essentially pick up on Califano in this context without paying attention, in my view, to the -- to the language difference in Califano, and you see the Seventh Circuit and the Fifth, Fourth, and Third all kind of go on the call -- Califano road, also a little bit with the greater includes the lesser point. And Califano doesn't work, as I think the government itself was going to have to acknowledge here, and so they're back-filling with textual arguments on 355(f), which you've answered, and then 231g. And I just would point out -- I think this is right, but you tell me if I'm wrong -- the government has never argued in this way the 231g point in all these cases. You know, you go back and look at the briefs and it's just not been part of that, presumably, because they've long understood, the Railroad Board at least, has long understood that denials of reopening, just like grants of reopening, obviously change your benefits if it's a grant of reopening, and so a denial too determines your rights and liabilities. So I think that I guess my understanding of the history of this is quite a bit different in terms of the case law in going back to Judge Friendly's opinion and what Justice Breyer said. And you can -- I mean, that's a favorable question to you, obviously. But, if you want to fill in any gaps there, go ahead.",19-199.wav,61,128.93500000000017,25349600,27412560,384,2.978244852057234,0.0025286888816781,7.551398394991192,0.302273584052554,7.231359713524659,7.414693046857993,7.481359713524659,7.589693046857993,8.714693046857992,250.0,1.9389614922247616,-2.0777975596733183,0.5123855421686747,0.2057745019596456,-15.562669049269845,0.2517057061195373,41.785141843439725,27.194327673971948,150.39492753623188,105.21289158651008,3.6720848504363617,0.9250921849183092,0.28827283278167437,0.0885866980349623,0.08267825216654537,0.05598365733477938,7.302647592312538,0.09655138904451238,7.131531228676175,0.1642337783726713,7.404602137767084,0.10076849787715361,7.537746077161023,0.145950966081457,8.134930016554963,0.4566865213451057,0.0025722081712864233,0.001067457467631925,7.447458978103783,0.11757742611642309,0.23515437131928815,0.093778177989873,106.37943262411348,70.00860142144354,2.6024435303402793,0.4200907396457913,-0.15217291260408963,0.6377656946574696

It -- I mean, it sort of reminds me of something you see on some TV shows about the -- the quest for an animal that was thought to have become extinct, like the Tasmanian tiger, which was thought to have died out in a zoo in 1936, but every once in a while, deep in the forests of Tasmania, somebody sees a footprint in the mud or a howl in the night or some fleeting thing running by, and they say, a-ha, there still is one that exists. So, I mean, all of that is a wind-up to getting back to the question that Justice Thomas asked.

So I want to focus on the watershed inquiry, and in that inquiry, we've talked a lot about accuracy. And I think somebody previously asked you about your empirical evidence, and I'll just give you sort of my sense that the empirics here are sparse, maybe surprisingly sparse, as to how this unanimity requirement works with respect to what I take to be the ordinary meaning of ""accuracy,"" which is simply a reduction in the error rate in trials. And -- and so too it seems like one's intuition is not necessarily in your corner, that it might be that the unanimity rule allows more guilty people to go free than it -- than it stops innocent people from being convicted, or at least it's just not certain. So I -- I guess what I -- I'd like to ask you is whether your -- well, I mean, number one, do you just contest all of everything that I just said? But, number two, are -- are you talking about accuracy in some different sense? Your first sentence to us was, ""A verdict by a nonunanimous jury is no verdict at all."" And then you talked about a verdict can be inaccurate and unfair even though it leads to the right decision.

I had been concerned that your approach would require us to chart a new path on retroactivity. As Justice Thomas and Justice Alito pointed out, we have a long line of cases, and you were just discussing with Justice Gorsuch post-Teague cases, such as Whorton about the Crawford rule and -- and many others where we have declined to apply a new rule retroactively on collateral. I'm also, though, concerned about the -- some of the pre-Teague cases which I think are on point here. The Chief Justice brought up DeStefano. You've -- you've equated Ramos to Gideon. The dissenters in DeStefano equated the jury trial right itself to Gideon, Justice Douglas and Justice Black, in their dissents, and I just want to give you an opportunity.

643,32,3470.845,3610.92,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, General Murrill. In Ramos, Justice Gorsuch's opinion and -- and mine as well talked about the history of nonunanimous juries, the linkage to racist origins. I know your point about the 1974 adoption. But I also looked at the -- how it was linked to the history of race-based peremptory strikes in Batson and how those two things had come from a -- from a similar place, a similar unfortunate place in our history, in the court -- in the country's history. And in this case, you know, there's a black defendant. The state uses its peremptory strikes to strike all but one black juror -- uses four of its six peremptories against black venire persons -- strikes five blacks for cause because several of them -- in part, for several of them -- had a family history of incarceration. And you're left with one black juror with a black defendant. Then you get a 11-to-1 verdict on the armed robbery count, the two kidnapping counts -- one of the armed robbery counts, two kidnapping counts, and the rape count. And the one juror is the black -- black woman, the black juror. This case seems like a classic example of what we were concerned about with the combination of peremptory challenges being used on the basis of race, maybe not to strike every juror but to strike all but one, and then the nonunanimous jury system complementing the -- the peremptory challenges. I know there wasn't a Batson -- successful Batson challenge in this case, but the facts of this case certainly seem troubling on how it all played out.

So, in showing special solicitude for Nazi-era claims, the Clarification Act clearly assumes that some such claims against Nazi-era confiscations of property would be going forward and that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act would not bar them. So, if your interpretation of the expropriation exception is correct to say that it applies only when there's a foreign national suing a government for the taking of property, what kind of class of claims are those? I guess I would open up some of the difficult questions of nationality and citizenship that Justice Alito was asking you, but could we expect there would have been or was there a large subset of claims brought against Nazi governments -- Nazi-controlled governments by foreign nationals?

First, Dr. Greenblatt modeled that without any water consumption by Georgia, salinity would have changed by one to eight parts per thousand but generally less than five ppts. Then you have Dr. Kimbro, who he relied on, and his experiments show that to see any appreciable effect on predation, you need salinity changes of 5 to 15 ppts. And then you have Dr. White, who predicted that if Georgia had not consumed any water, oyster biomass in 2012 would have been 7 to 10 percent higher. I'm doubtful that a 10 percent change is sufficient to be viewed as an invasion of rights of a serious magnitude.

So, for example, you've made great strides in -- in improving irrigation efficiency. I see that in the record.

So Special Master Kelly seems to have concluded that a modest injury -- and -- and it, you know, put the injury to Florida from Georgia's actions at about 1.4 percent of a decrease in oyster biomass -- that a modest injury didn't justify an equitable decree, that the injury had to be serious. And I want to know if that's the right legal way to look at it.

In those circumstances, if you bring the courts into every single case, they would spend an awful lot of time adjudicating those cases, though nobody is really hurt, when there are lots of people who are really hurt who need their time and effort.

773,29,2198.8,2291.64,Elena_Kagan,scotus_justice,"General Mooppan, you have a lot of history on your side, but I think I want to give you a theory about why that history is not very relevant. I think that these cases that you have fall into three groups. The one are they are declaratory judgment actions in a world before declaratory judgment actions. In other words, they're ways to try to determine legal rights going forward before the declaratory judgment form existed. The second group of cases are cases in which there's injury that's hard to monetize, and -- and these cases are asking for something to recompense that injury. But the reason why those cases aren't very relevant anymore is that, in our world, we monetize those claims all the time. We now live in a world, unlike the historical world, in which we acknowledge claims for emotional distress, claims for dignitary harms of all kinds, which makes the nominal damages claim unnecessary. The third group of cases is a case in which what the plaintiff really wants is vindication. It's a statement that I'm right, the defendant is wrong. And as to those cases, modern Article III jurisprudence says that, you know, you don't -- that's not a case or controversy.

But we very clearly have stated that punitive damage -- damages are not to compensate the injured party but, rather, to punish the tortfeasor and deter him and others from similar extreme conduct. If a case has been mooted because an act is not capable of repetition, there's no need to impose punitive damages, no matter how reprehensible the conduct may be.

You've proven an injury. And nominal damages are directed to be paid to the plaintiff. He or she may not think they got too much.

And we have a lot of -- of amici briefs from religious groups that indicate, for example, that they have religious scruples against seeking damages for some injuries they've suffered. So they'd lose out, people like Ms. Swift and groups like that. And then it seems to me the second group that -- that -- that loses out are individuals whose claims are not sufficiently great to attract the attention of clever lawyers and economists to come up with damages theories. Emotional harm and distress is a particular example. Areas where it's difficult to quantify damages and expensive to do so require a large enough damage to justify the effort.

And then, on the attorney's fees question that's been raised, those -- if those were fully available, then that would provide, obviously, an incentive for some plaintiffs to continue litigating even if there was no other injunctive or compensatory relief at stake. But my understanding of the case law, Farrar, and it seems to be how it's applied in most lower courts, is that plaintiffs do not receive much in the way of attorney's fees when they only receive nominal damages, and, therefore, the incentive to litigate wastefully is not as present.

But it seems to me that, in your responses to Justice Alito's questions, Justice Kagan's questions, Justice Gorsuch's questions, you've kind of gone back and forth on the triviality of the money point. So, you know, you suggested to Justice Alito that at some point it's so little money that really should be taken into account. But, of course, our precedents say that, you know, even -- even a small amount is enough. And so, in the Taylor Swift example or in Justice Gorsuch's bus fare example, I -- I heard you -- at least I took you to concede that even a very trivial amount would constitute a compensatory injury under Article III.

Please assume with me the following: Assume that the -- what you read, the computer -- computer programs which do something, after all, are copyrightable, but then it says methods of operation are not, whether they're computer programs or not. The problem for us is, is this more like Baker v. Selden, where they said the accounting is not, it's a method of operation? Or is it more like an ordinary computer program? All right. Now what I got out of reading through this very good briefing is, look, Java's people divided the universe of tasks, of which there are billions, in a certain way. All the things that tell the computer to do one of those things, we'll do. But that which tells the computer which to do, that's the declaration. Here is what it's like. It's like, as Judge Boudin said, the QWERTY keyboard. You didn't have to have a QWERTY keyboard on typewriters at the beginning, but, my God, if you let somebody have a copyright on that now, they would control all typewriters, which really has nothing to do with copyright. Or it's like switchboards on old-fashioned telephone systems. You could have done it in 1,000 ways. But, once you did it, all those operators across the world learned that system, and you don't want to give a copyright holder a monopoly of -- hmm -- telephone systems. Or it's like, to use the Chief Justice's example, a chef who figures out brilliant ways of mixing spices and then putting the spices for this and that in a certain order on a shelf, and then he writes something that tells you which shelf to go to and which shelf to pick out -- and which spice to pick out for which dish. Now all those things are somewhat ordinary programs, but they also are doing something. They're giving you an instruction as to how to call up those programs that reflect Java's organization. And at this point in time, it's really tough, just like the QWERTY keyboard, to go backwards, and very bad consequences will flow if you don't see that distinction. Okay? Long question, but that's what I got out of their method of operation argument.

The problem with that argument for me is that it seems that since 1992, and Justice Kagan mentioned the case, the Second Circuit case, a Ninth Circuit case, an Eleventh Circuit case, a First Circuit case, that a basic principle has developed in the case law, up until the Federal Circuit's decision. I know there was a Third Circuit decision earlier on in the 1980s. But the other circuits moved away from that. They and the entire computer world have not tried to analogize computer codes to other methods of expression because it's sui generis. They've looked at its functions, and they've said the API, the Application Programming Interface, of which the declaring code is a part, is not copyrightable. Implementing codes are. And on that understanding, industries have built up around applications that know they can -- they can copy only what's necessary to run on the application, but they have to change everything else. That's what Google did here. That's why it took less than 1 percent of the Java code. So I guess that's the way the world has run in every other system. Whether it's Apple's desktop or Amazon's web services, everybody knows that APIs are not -- declaring codes are not copyrightable. Implementing codes are.

842,36,4121.0,4200.0,Stephen_G_Breyer,scotus_justice,"I'm curious as to why the government thinks the balance of harms lies the way you do. I do think of the QWERTY keyboard. The QWERTY, the keyboard, calls up the metal rods that make an impression on a piece of paper and then that's how you write words. This system calls up a system of dividing the world into a variety of tasks which then will be done. Now nothing in copyright is meant to give the owner of the QWERTY, whoever thought of that beginning, QWERTY, a copy -- a monopoly of typewriting. And nothing here, they say, if, in fact, you give them a monopoly of this, the millions of people who have learned this, as Justice Sotomayor says, will have to spend vast amounts of money when we get all kinds of new methods for using computers turning on heaters, stoves, et cetera, and a million others.

And they said that the company didn't follow reasonable procedures. And they said in the second letter they didn't get the summary of rights. So they were all typical in that respect. But Ramirez also went out and tried to buy something and got into a lot of trouble, it was all complicated, dah-dah-dah.

She asked you to distinguish between what would happen if they filed within the five-year period in which they would know whether the risk had materialized or outside the five-year period, say in the sixth year. I want to know what would happen, say, if they filed in year two, but the litigation drags on and on and on and the case doesn't come to its conclusion until year six. So, if I understand your response to Justice Kagan, it would essentially mean that people had standing at the outset of the suit. But, if they were in the 50 percent that were home-free, they would lose their standing by the end? I mean, that just seems like an odd way to think about it since we normally judge standing at the outset, and when something dissipates over the course of a suit, we think about it in terms of mootness, not that the injury isn't concrete.

And it seems like this case is about whether, even going beyond that, a big risk that the tort would actually happen to you is itself a tort. And I -- I haven't heard you disclaim that as a proper reading of Spokeo.

902,48,4713.11,4817.09,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Issacharoff. I think you have a good argument with respect to the 1,853 in terms of the reasonable procedures, but I'm more concerned about the 6,332, whose information was not, in essence, published. Under -- in Spokeo, of course, the information was published, which is a big distinction, as I see it, between that case and this, as to the 6,332. And when Spokeo talked then about risk of harm, it was talking about harm beyond the publication, at least as I understood it, for example, publication of ZIP codes, which strikes me as a very different thing than risk -- talking about risk of harm when there hasn't been publication to begin with. So that -- that's point one. And then, on -- on risk of harm, you heard me talk about damages versus injunctive relief. It strikes me that risk of harm, of course, is enough to get you injunctive relief. With damages, I -- I hadn't thought risk of harm would get you damages -- standing for damages claims unless the risk of harm was itself a harm. Judge Tatel in the D.C. Circuit analogized it: If inaccurate information falls into a database, does it make a sound? And his answer to that, applying Stoke -- Spokeo, was no. And I guess then-Judge Barrett, talking about no harm/no foul, seemed to be picking up on the same thing. So can you respond to the distinction between this case and Spokeo and then try to help me on risk of harm for the 6,332?",20-297.wav,242,103.98000000000047,75409760,77073440,263,2.529332563954595,0.0018167693951347,7.387686602804098,0.1773199000705018,7.123026380191326,7.25635971352466,7.348026380191326,7.489693046857993,7.819359713524659,384.0,3.6930178880553775,-1.8422375131620847,0.2692010443864229,0.0634046358213636,-43.63817131292852,-0.1685240268707275,41.785141843439725,27.194327673971948,150.39492753623188,105.21289158651008,3.6720848504363617,0.9250921849183092,0.28827283278167437,0.0885866980349623,0.08267825216654537,0.05598365733477938,7.302647592312538,0.09655138904451238,7.131531228676175,0.1642337783726713,7.404602137767084,0.10076849787715361,7.537746077161023,0.145950966081457,8.134930016554963,0.4566865213451057,0.0025722081712864233,0.001067457467631925,7.447458978103783,0.11757742611642309,0.23515437131928815,0.093778177989873,106.37943262411348,70.00860142144354,2.6024435303402793,0.4200907396457913,-0.15217291260408963,0.6377656946574696

I have a question about whether you can ever have a bare procedural violation with respect to any of these consumer protection statutes, like FCRA or the FDCPA. I mean, all of them have procedures that are designed to protect against a risk of harm. So, you know, whether it's to have information put clearly on two pages instead of one or, you know, whether it's to say that certain things must be in writing or whether it's -- I'm thinking of many of the cases that the lower courts have dealt with -- not having so many numbers of your credit card receipt -- credit card number reflected on a receipt, all of these are designed to protect a consumer against the risk of some harm. So is there any violation that you can think of -- and I'm talking about -- I'm not talking about the disclosure here. I mean I'm not talking about the reasonable procedures claim and the disclosure of private information. I'm talking about these procedural guardrails like this.

The -- the other argument that was -- I believe it's in the lower court and that the Respondents make is Congress had a good reason for making this a single connected exemption.

I want to explore with you the relevance, as others have mentioned, of the ""at any time"" language and just get your sense of how that works here. I guess what you're saying is the word ""extension"" under your temporal extension argument could be read in one of two ways.

And the alternative story is the one that you just suggested, which is that this is really conduct-forcing.

943,37,4136.84,4284.56,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Michel. Mr. Keisler's second argument in his brief, which is his lead argument today, the argument that the extension, the word ""extension"" is temporal but does not have to be continuous, just to set up how I'm thinking about this and then get your response, you know, you -- you admit it's not an unambiguous word. I think Congress uses ""extension"" sometimes even when something's lapsed. We have the examples -- COVID and other examples. You make a big deal about ordinary usage, but I'll give you three instances in my life where ordinary usage goes the other way from what you -- what you say. So sometimes one that you're teaching and you have a 5:00 p.m. due date for a paper, you know, after the due date, you will get an e-mail entitled Extension Request, you grant a paper extension afterwards. Or when a -- you use a sports contract example in your brief, but oftentimes, if the contract ends at the end of the season, in the off-season, the player signs a new contract. That will be described by most people as player extends for two more years. Or, if you let your print newspaper subscription lapse for a time and then you start it up again, you'll tell your family member or friend, oh, I extended the paper subscription. So I -- I think ordinary usage also, like congressional usage, in my experience at least doesn't tell us exactly. So how do we break this?

971,14,1217.31,1316.1,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, counsel. I wanted to give you my thought about how I'm looking at this and get your reaction. So, on the tax, I see this as a Subchapter 68 penalty that, therefore, qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. On Direct Marketing, it seems to me that that's arguably distinct because the penalty there was not a tax. Here, it is so defined as a tax and, therefore, comes within the scope of the Anti-Injunction Act. Then we get to the question -- and there's -- and there's other questions -- but the regulatory tax question, the Bob Jones and Alexander cases, and I want to get your reaction to this, which is I think reading those cases as they are poses a problem for you, but I'm not sure those cases are -- should be read for all they're worth. In other words, I'm wondering whether those cases -- we should back away from some of the implications of those cases for challenges to regulatory taxes for the reasons, some of the reasons you've given here, that it seems somewhat unfair, as it did even in those cases, somewhat unfair to force someone to go through the process that you're talking about here. So should we back away from Bob Jones and Alexander? How would we do that best without flat-out overruling them, or -- or should we go that far?",19-930.wav,80,98.78999999999996,19476960,21057600,242,2.449640651887844,0.0036790665695891,7.516358354090185,0.1997647984822919,7.20635971352466,7.38135971352466,7.489693046857993,7.614693046857993,8.039693046857993,461.0,4.666464217026016,-2.600638254514993,0.2137043478260869,0.0517840865028355,-39.95995790530332,-0.0362783558666706,41.785141843439725,27.194327673971948,150.39492753623188,105.21289158651008,3.6720848504363617,0.9250921849183092,0.28827283278167437,0.0885866980349623,0.08267825216654537,0.05598365733477938,7.302647592312538,0.09655138904451238,7.131531228676175,0.1642337783726713,7.404602137767084,0.10076849787715361,7.537746077161023,0.145950966081457,8.134930016554963,0.4566865213451057,0.0025722081712864233,0.001067457467631925,7.447458978103783,0.11757742611642309,0.23515437131928815,0.093778177989873,106.37943262411348,70.00860142144354,2.6024435303402793,0.4200907396457913,-0.15217291260408963,0.6377656946574696

Now it's true that if it's successful in invalidating a reporting requirement, then you don't get to enforce that reporting requirement through a tax penalty.

993,36,3185.515,3348.04,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you. And good afternoon, Mr. Bond. I'm going to tell you where I'm -- I think I'm with you and where I think I have a problem. On the text of the Anti-Injunction Act, I think you have a strong argument, Subchapter 68 and how that fits here. This penalty is designated a tax; therefore, it fits within the AIA. Direct Marketing, I think you have a good point. That was not subject -- that penalty was not denominated a tax and, therefore, the reason the two cases would be different is that the text of the statutes is different. You make a good point there, I think. In terms of the Regan point, how you would do this, you say you file a letter objecting to it, and you then have post- -- you have proceedings after the IRS assesses the penalty. That all makes sense to me as well. The criminal point, Justice Alito's point, you just said the Court could flat-out say that it's not a willful violation when you're challenging the reporting requirement being unlawful. So that -- we could -- we could say that. Here's where I think I have a concern: On Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander, those cases, you were having a discussion with Justice Kagan, either/or, are you challenging the regulatory aspect of this or the reporting aspect of this, or are you challenging the tax aspect? I think you're challenging both as a plaintiff really. And what Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander seem to say -- and this supports you -- is that when you're doing that, you have to go -- the AIA applies. And I -- I agree with you that those cases support you. But I also think Justice Gorsuch makes a very good point that the current philosophy that's -- those cases are from a different era. The current philosophy of challenging administrative action is different, as the Chief Justice said, with presumptions. And, here, where I really think Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander may be different is when the penalties are so high if you lose. In other words, you have to bet, and if you bet and lose, penalties are so high that it's going to deter you from challenging the regulatory or reporting aspect in the first place. So the bottom -- long-wind up, bottom-line question. Shouldn't -- as a matter of fairness, modern era of administrative law, presumptions, shouldn't we carve out an exception from Bob Jones, Alexander, Bailey, when the penalties for trying to challenge something are so high that it's going to be coercive and effectively deter you from bringing this kind of challenge in the first place?",19-930.wav,169,162.5250000000001,50968240,53568640,451,2.774957698815565,0.0032413579538621,7.514389296197665,0.2030365109983904,7.180026380191326,7.373026380191326,7.498026380191326,7.63135971352466,8.017359713524657,733.0,4.510075373019533,-2.0593448672618107,0.2216830601092896,0.0451499541939145,-52.93783107240455,0.4967644214630127,41.785141843439725,27.194327673971948,150.39492753623188,105.21289158651008,3.6720848504363617,0.9250921849183092,0.28827283278167437,0.0885866980349623,0.08267825216654537,0.05598365733477938,7.302647592312538,0.09655138904451238,7.131531228676175,0.1642337783726713,7.404602137767084,0.10076849787715361,7.537746077161023,0.145950966081457,8.134930016554963,0.4566865213451057,0.0025722081712864233,0.001067457467631925,7.447458978103783,0.11757742611642309,0.23515437131928815,0.093778177989873,106.37943262411348,70.00860142144354,2.6024435303402793,0.4200907396457913,-0.15217291260408963,0.6377656946574696

You know, this is very technical stuff here, but, as I understood it, and correct me if I'm wrong, there's some water that belongs to Texas. It hasn't got to Texas yet. And for whatever reason, I thought probably because Texas asked, New Mexico stores it in a reservoir, and then some of that evaporates. So the question is, is Texas given a debit for the amount that had belonged to Texas, the evaporated water, which you can't get because it's in the sky. And the River Master says yes. That seems to make sense. That's why we appoint River Masters, to figure those things out. You say: Oh, no, nothing in the contract allows -- nothing in the -- you know, the basic document here, the agreement, the compact, nothing allows that. Well, the SG says: Go read how they did it. They did it according to the report of the Engineering Advisory Committee, and that's how they decided that evaporation question. That seems right. And then he pointed to VI(c), which says, unless there's a more feasible method, you ought to use the report of the Engineering Advisory Committee. And that's what the -- that's what he used. So I understood this very simply. The water's gone. It evaporated. They go to the Advisory Committee's report. They use that and say the evaporated water is Texas's.

First, they'd say: We deal with that problem up here -- you know, haven't you read Rule 39(a) -- and if there's a dispute, I'll go ask the writing judge what he or she wants to do, and if there's still going to be a fight, we'll send it down to the district court.

Only the court of appeals, for example, can say, you know, the appellant doesn't get all its costs; it only gets 80 percent of its costs. But then there seems as though there's a second level of discretion, and this is what you were talking with Justice Alito about. He said, you know, (e), 39(e) says taxable. That suggests some kind of discretion. What is that discretion that's taking place in the district court?

So the question presented asks in part whether the district court has the discretion to reduce appellate costs.

So I gather that you're not really denying that the district court, through 1924, has some authority to reduce when it reviews the costs for excessive copying, et cetera, but just that in this particular case of the supersedeas bond, that it doesn't have the authority to reduce it because the time for that particular cost has come and gone.

Why should we not adhere to the basic interpretive principle that counsels in favor of a harmonious reading and against choosing an interpretation that produces a substantial effect that is inconsistent with the text of another provision?

1103,14,1257.76000005,1347.815,Neil_Gorsuch,scotus_justice,"Good morning, Mr. Suri. I wanted to ask about a passage in your reply brief on pages 12 and 13. Your argument, as I understand it, is, under 1231, that there is a final order of removal dating back to the original order of removal. But, for purposes of 1252, the question becomes, is there some chance for judicial review of -- of the withholding-only proceedings? And -- and -- and that -- that statute also grants review only of the final order of removal. Judge Richardson acknowledged this difficulty in his dissent in the Fourth Circuit and said that means that there's effectively going to be no judicial review of withholding-only proceedings. But the government apparently in the Fourth Circuit thought that there could be. And, here, on 12 and 13, I -- I -- I -- I see the government, forgive me, as maybe hedging its bets and -- and -- and -- and not really taking a position on this.

And I'm wondering why the default isn't set to release with supervision. And -- and here's my reasoning: As I look at the statute, the removal period itself is 90 days. But, if it's the alien's fault that the government is not able to remove the alien during this 90 days -- and I'm looking at the period -- the provision in (a)(1)(C), which says, if the alien fails or refuses to make timely application for travel documents, et cetera, that removal period, as defined in the statute, let's say it might be 200 days. But then I'm looking at (a)(3), which talks about supervision after the 90-day period and says, you know, if the alien does not leave or is not removed within the removal period, defined as 90 days in the statute, it says the alien shall be subject to supervision under the regulations. So why isn't the default that, if it's through the fault of the government or no fault of the noncitizen that removal doesn't take place within the removal period, why isn't the default supervision, rather than, as you suggested to Justice Sotomayor, continued confinement?",19-897.wav,101,83.27500005000002,27010160,28342561,219,2.629840887043025,0.0051415057249237,8.215520434888116,0.1980857012423097,7.931359713524659,8.081359713524659,8.164693046857993,8.314693046857993,8.76785971352466,325.0,3.902731909995357,-2.3334052392934352,0.2533333333333333,0.051960888888889,-48.1503951186638,-0.4827134609222412,31.329653978892733,17.799843862992585,106.47872340425532,56.62237942497018,3.555499140059202,0.9243676618709977,0.292260531059413,0.07291140549112178,0.0695320845119844,0.047776714891189835,7.972789973571941,0.0834746696603374,7.8088183423662665,0.10863631353482803,8.069110895557756,0.08317451323940073,8.203101734801255,0.08721261969677108,8.608499193430097,0.12222809192149743,0.004759664517729163,0.0012970511412573789,8.105671568524839,0.07855932191949493,0.19323029233396308,0.030968774711040016,96.52595155709342,52.435080740223505,3.181076439793327,0.5093808420961355,-0.12663917561387159,0.5795474391623492

1123,34,3260.35,3316.06,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you. And good morning, Mr. Hughes. Looking at the language of 1226, it, of course, says ""pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed."" And then, when you go to 1231, it makes clear that that decision on whether the alien is to be removed has really already been made automatically in the case of someone who reenters the country illegally because the prior order of removal is reinstated.

So we're comparing here two statutes, 1226 and 1231, and -- and I'm trying to figure out how much of the scheme in 1226 that's advantageous in terms of offering a bond hearing to the noncitizen is regulatory and how much is statutory, because, in your brief on page 7, you say, ""After an initial custody determination by DHS, Congress determined that a noncitizen is entitled to a bond hearing before an IJ."" But, as support for that, you cite a regulation, not a statutory provision. And as far as I can tell, in 1226 itself, the bond hearing looks discretionary because it says that the alien may be released on bond.

The briefs that are supported -- that are submitted in support of the Respondents paint a pretty stark picture, and they argue that colleges with powerhouse football and basketball programs are really exploiting the students that they recruit. They have programs that bring in billions of dollars. As Justice Thomas mentioned, the -- this money funds enormous salaries for coaches and others in huge athletic departments. But the athletes themselves have a pretty hard life. They face training requirements that leave little time or energy for study, constant pressure to put sports above study, pressure to drop out of hard majors and hard classes, really shockingly low graduation rates. Only a tiny percentage ever go on to make any money in professional sports. So the argument is they are recruited, they're used up, and then they're cast aside without even a college degree.

And we usually give that a pretty quick look, maybe even a twinkling of the eye. So that all -- that all makes sense to me, and we certainly don't want to go back to the bad old days of reviewing any joint venture agreement that restricts competition through per se analysis or -- or something that looks like a strict scrutiny analysis, which I understand you condemn the -- the Ninth Circuit for doing. So I understand all of that. I think the trick comes for me at least sort of where Justice Kagan was alluding to, which is, here, the agreement that's really at the center of the case is an agreement among competitors to fix price with the labor market, where you have monopsony control, and that's unusual. The normal joint venture is -- is in a competitive market. But, here, the NCAA has monopsony control over labor price. There aren't other leagues which might compete with the NCAA that might allow payments, and you could test consumer demand that way.

1142,15,1891.68,2009.72,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Waxman. I want to pick up from Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch and identify some issues of concern to me as I look at this. I start from the idea that the antitrust laws should not be a cover for exploitation of the student-athletes, so that is a concern, a overarching concern here. I see your rhetoric and tradition and history argument being very similar to the arguments that were made for exempting baseball from the antitrust laws, Flood v. Kuhn, Federal -- Federal Baseball, and that -- that exemption has not been replicated in other sports in other cases. And then, in Regents, as Justice Kagan said, that really was from a different era, it -- it was dicta, not sure it was fully considered dicta, and, in any event, from a different era. So then we get to regular antitrust law, rule of reason, and I just want to drill down on your asserted procompetitive justification and how you say the product is differentiated. It does seem, as Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch suggested, Justice Alito, that schools are conspiring with competitors, agreeing with competitors, I'll say that, to pay no salaries to the workers who are making the schools billions of dollars on the theory that consumers want the schools to pay their workers nothing. And that just seems entirely circular and even somewhat disturbing. And then, as Justice Kagan says, it's not even factually supported in the record in this case. It seems to blend back to the tradition argument, and all things circle back to this idea, well, it should just -- just don't worry about it, college athletics is different, just like baseball. So those are the concerns I have initially.

And then (f)(3)(B) does not say that but instead uses a very different formulation, drops the section numbers, and says liability for some or all of a response action.

1185,15,2007.275,2116.98,Stephen_G_Breyer,scotus_justice,"Well, the trouble I'm having on your side is I can't get too far using the language of the statute. I mean, sure, you could read it your way, ""response action"" refers to any action, state or federal, brought under any statute dealing with a response action, which is defined in 23, 24. It could mean that, but it could also mean CERCLA actions, okay? It could mean either. And if I look at the definition of ""response,"" it starts by saying ""for purposes of this subchapter."" Then I look at the definition of ""response"" and it's about 450 to 500 words, including all kinds of things -- I'm tempted to say anything under the sun, that isn't quite true -- but all kinds of technical things, perimeter protection using dikes, you know, collection of leachate. How do I know whether a state has a collection of leachate law that has nothing really to do with CERCLA? And I don't know. But there could be a lot of lawyers who don't know. And when they go into any one of what could be thousands of cases that involve some of these 450 or 500 words under some law of a state or other federal law, do they know they have only three years to ask for contribution? I mean, this is a pretty tough reading, and a lot of people just won't know they have only three years. They might think they had seven or something else.

We have a brief from, I think, about 25, 26 states and territories, including some very different ones, everything from -- everybody from Massachusetts to Wyoming, saying that that would seriously impair state cleanup efforts to federalize and preempt every -- every -- every -- every settlement, if you can read ""response action"" quite so broadly, and that this is going to wind up impairing cleanup efforts rather than advancing them.

So whether it was Neder, the defendant knew that someone had to find materiality. It was the same thing in Johnson. But this is the kind of case where no defendant knew that there could be an actual defense at all. So why wouldn't we find that a structural error?

Under ACCA, the government has the burden of showing that the increased sentence is warranted, so it has to carry the burden of looking to the least elements approach. But it's different when you're seeking the benefit of removal under the immigration case. There, the person who's seeking -- has the burden of -- that benefit is your client, and, therefore, you have the burden of showing the most elements approach for the prior conviction. Why isn't it simply the different burdens under ACCA and the immigration statute that account for the fact that in one case -- the different burden of going forward? Whether you're seeking a greater sentence or seeking the benefit of removal, why doesn't that simply account for the allocation of the burden of proof?

It -- it came from the categorical and modified categorical approaches. They are called categorical because they are making a categorical determination. And take the example of burglary, which has been central to our cases in this area. So you have somebody who's convicted of burglary under, let's say, California law, and the question is whether that is a conviction for generic burglary. It -- it is a -- it is a determination about an entire category of cases; that is, all of the cases prosecuted and convicted under the California burglary statute. And it is in that situation where the court asks -- looks to the least of the acts criminalized. It asks what is the least thing that could get somebody convicted of burglary in California. Would that constitute generic burglary? If the answer to that is no, then it flunks under the categorical test. But what's involved here is not categorical at all.

To me, it looks like this is probably a factual question about, a contingent set of questions about, what happened in a particular time and place. We're not interpreting any law, any neutral principle, any generally applicable provision. I don't see how Johnson helps because the burden there was on the government in a criminal case. And so I -- so I'm stuck on a lot of that, and maybe you can unstick me. And the other thing I'm also stuck on, just for what it's worth, is the burden in terms of producing the -- the evidence of a conviction mentioned in subsection (3) is the burdens on proving -- the government has while proving deportability, totally different than subsection (4), which is applications for relief from removal or deportability, which then fall on the immigrant. So that -- that's putting my cards on the table as what I'm stuck on. What I'm -- what I'm hopeful for or want to explore a little bit is Shepard and why you concede that -- or, I don't know, maybe you don't -- that there is -- that this is all categorical approach. Justice Breyer in, I think it was Nijhawan -- you can correct my pronunciation, I'm sure -- said that Shepard, you know, is a -- the categorical approach in the ACCA context may not always apply in the INA context.

So why isn't the simple thing to do, keeping the law uniform, simple, as much as it can be, if we read Taylor? And when we read Taylor, here's how you decide whether a statute that says, in Section 1342(a), burglary of a car, a house, or a boat, and some are and some are not federal burglary, and which one was this? Was he convicted of a boat burglary or a house? And here's what it says to do: You look at the statute. Well, that doesn't help. They're all three. Then you look at the indictment or information. And then you look at the jury instructions. Now, if those three things, the statute, the jury instructions, and the -- and the indictment or information, show that this was burglary of a house, that it necessarily, we've said in about 10 cases, is burglary of a house, the government wins. And if they don't, the other side wins. Well, with slightly different words here, slightly different documents do the same thing. Does the statute forbid that? Of course not. The statute that you're talking about has words in it, and those words say that if the evidence indicates one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of relief apply, then the government wins. So we look at the listed documents, we see if they do, and that's the end of the case; if they don't necessarily show that, then he's carried his burden of proof.

So we have a simple rule that treats pretty much all agency cases roughly alike -- sometimes there are exceptions -- that what a court of appeals does with a factual matter or some matter like this really is look for substantial evidence, end of matter. So, if, in fact, there's a finding he's credible, then you take that finding and you say is there, with that finding, substantial evidence. And if it's the opposite, you say the opposite, is there substantial evidence. And if the judge doesn't say, Congress tells us what to do. Presume that he's telling the truth, but the presumption is rebuttable, so if nobody says anything, you look at it and you simply say, assuming it was rebutted, we assume that the judge found it was rebutted, and is there substantial evidence? Period. With the assumption that it was rebutted. And that could include, there isn't enough evidence to show it was rebutted. That will just be part of the matter.

""Credible"" means capable of being believed, worthy of belief. It doesn't mean that the testimony is accurate. A person -- it may turn out that it's inaccurate.

On the statutory language, if I could start there and pick up on Justice Gorsuch's questioning, it says if no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made -- and you said that's by the IJ -- the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal. And I just want to know what work the presumption does and -- on -- on appeal. In other words, I would think the presumption does work when there's no other evidence at all, other than the testimony of the applicant, and there hasn't been an adverse credibility determination. Then there's -- then you have that presumption of credibility on appeal, and, presumably, that will sustain the burden. But you can tell me if that's wrong.

1279,22,2261.1,2421.935,Amy_Coney_Barrett,scotus_justice,"Good morning, Ms. Sinzdak. I -- I have to say join me up with Justices Alito and Kagan. I'm baffled by the distinction that you're drawing between ""credibility"" and ""persuasiveness."" And it's not actually consistent with the way that I've seen cases come up for review in the court of appeals from IJs who make adverse credibility determinations. The ones I've seen, you know, they've essentially been equivalent to saying that the witness is lying. This -- this fine distinction between ""believable"" and ""believed"" just seems, you know, nitpicking to me. As Justice Kavanaugh was saying, it seems to me more like ""credibility"" refers to are they lying, and then ""persuasiveness,"" as Justice Kavanaugh was suggesting, points to other reasons why you might not believe them. So I could -- you know, thinking about your example with the child and the crumbs, I was thinking as you talked about an example about my child. I come home and find the child hysterically crying, and she said someone was beating at the door, I think somebody was trying to break into her house -- our house. And I can believe her. I don't think she's lying. But then my neighbor says, yeah, you know, I -- I saw it was the UPS man. So I would not find her story persuasive, not because of credibility but because there was other evidence that showed she was not, in fact, in danger. It was the UPS deliveryman. So I don't think that -- you -- you seem to be leaning heavily on the fact that the statute uses both the words ""credibility"" and ""persuasiveness,"" and I just don't see it. So I want to ask you what's wrong with seeing it this way: that the IJ makes a determination about credibility, and that has to be express, and when it gets up to the Board, there are two ways in which the Board might have to confront this presumption. Either the IJ actually found the alien incredible and the Board disagrees, in which case it has to confront the presumption and explain why it thinks the evidence rebuts that presumption of credibility, or the IJ might not have done a good enough job in making an adverse credibility determination explicit, as the statute requires, and then, still, the Board has to presume credibility and then explain why it thinks the presumption is rebutted. If the Board offers such an explanation, once it gets up to the court of appeals, the court of appeals isn't applying any kind of presumption. The court of appeals is just reviewing it for substantial evidence and seeing if the Board's explanation -- and the Board has to show that it understood what presumption should be there -- whether the Board's explanation was rational and substantial evidence supported its determination that the alien was not telling the truth. Is that an okay way to think about it, and how is that different from your way?",19-1155.wav,121,160.83500000000004,36177600,38750960,496,3.0839058662604524,0.0069954508664585,8.165068422233368,0.2126364413329113,7.814693046857993,8.014693046857992,8.139693046857992,8.28135971352466,8.708859713524657,468.0,2.9098144060683304,-1.4410917362685964,0.3429550321199143,0.0839125011898812,-24.32010771641301,1.4268354177474976,31.329653978892733,17.799843862992585,106.47872340425532,56.62237942497018,3.555499140059202,0.9243676618709977,0.292260531059413,0.07291140549112178,0.0695320845119844,0.047776714891189835,7.972789973571941,0.0834746696603374,7.8088183423662665,0.10863631353482803,8.069110895557756,0.08317451323940073,8.203101734801255,0.08721261969677108,8.608499193430097,0.12222809192149743,0.004759664517729163,0.0012970511412573789,8.105671568524839,0.07855932191949493,0.19323029233396308,0.030968774711040016,96.52595155709342,52.435080740223505,3.181076439793327,0.5093808420961355,-0.12663917561387159,0.5795474391623492

But that's true of district court judges: When they make a lot of findings that are appealed, they don't always have to write. It could be the situation. It could be implicit from the record that they assumed that it was rebutted. Lower courts or the agency thought the presumption was rebutted. Now you don't have to write about everything on -- an agency doesn't have to and a district judge doesn't have to.

It says, the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal if no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made. I think the purpose of that was that if the only real testimony in the record is from the applicant that -- and the IJ did not say, I think the applicant is lying or make an adverse credibility determination, it would not be open to the BIA to -- to do that. But, by -- and this is what I want you to focus on -- by using the phrase ""rebuttable presumption"" -- I think Justice Kagan was talking about this and Justice Gorsuch -- if other evidence comes in, it's not just the applicant's testimony and you have nothing else, other testimony comes in, then that you just do normal substantial evidence review as the reviewing court.

The applicant didn't perjure himself. But then there are -- there is extraneous evidence that could come in to show that the applicant was wrong. And -- and -- and that distinction actually makes all the sense in the world in a statute like this, which is about a well-grounded fear of persecution, that the applicant can testify as to his fear and all the things underlying it. But then there can be other evidence which shows that that fear is not well grounded, notwithstanding the truthfulness of what the applicant said. So let's take that as the sort of premise of what the statute does. Dai, it seems to me, could have lost in two ways in -- in that world. One is if we understand the Board to have rejected the -- the -- the -- the presumption of credibility. In other words, they have decided that, in fact, Dai was lying when he said that this was the reason that he wanted asylum. And the second is, no, they accepted that he was telling the truth, but there is extraneous evidence indicating that he's wrong as to his fear of going back to China.

And let's say a plan -- or let's say just about every plan decides that the price of Tier C drugs was so high that the plan simply could not afford to provide those drugs to its participants. That is affecting the beneficiaries and what they get. And it's affecting, at least for those who -- who are not on fixed co-pays but on percentage co-pays -- your fixed ones, I'm assuming, is when you pay 5, 10, 15, or $20 for each drug, as opposed to one that says, we'll pay 80 percent and you pay 20.

Everything does relate to everyone -- everything else. So what kind of ""relate to""? And, obviously, the Court's struggled with that. What about a state setting prices, high prices or low prices, of hospital services, of pencils, of orange juice? They all relate to cost. So we got out of that one by saying: Well, even the hospital services, even that, just raising prices isn't a close enough relation. Hmm, that's interesting. Now you put that on -- you've taken an aspect of that. You said, well, no, it's the procedures that you use in order to decide what the prices are that's the problem. But every form of rate regulation involves procedures. They all do. And, therefore, we're going to get into the same business. How much procedure is too much? How much is too little? What kind of procedures? Wouldn't it be simpler to read that word ""relate to"" that we'd have to go back on language and say what it means is ordinary principles of preemption. They're complicated enough.

But this whole statute, RFRA, is really an effort to put into statutory form a certain kind of constitutional interpretation that Smith, in fact, rejected. And there was a lot of concern in Congress. There would have been no personal action if they had maintained the older interpretation of the First Amendment. So why would Congress want to have the personal action here when they never could have had it if what Congress would have thought was the right view of the -- of the religious Free Exercise Clause had been maintained in -- in the Constitution?

If this were a 301 presumption, I would say the judge has, on the plaintiff's side, whatever inference naturally arises from the evidence that the plaintiff has put in to satisfy Basic.

1492,46,4172.12,4261.24,Neil_Gorsuch,scotus_justice,"Good morning, Mr. Goldstein. You know, as I understand it, you know, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that this is a class that needs to be certified. Then comes in a presumption as part of that that a misstatement of fact affects price because of the efficient market theory. Fine. Then the defendant comes forward with direct evidence saying, well, in this case, this misstatement did not affect price. And the question then is, what -- what happens next? And it seems to me one of two things could happen. One, the plaintiff can come forward with evidence, as you did here, trying to rebut that direct evidence and say, uh-uh, you're wrong, that -- that -- that, here, it did, in fact, affect price. And -- and -- and you may carry your burden of proof and win the day. The other alternative, though, is, if we flip the burden and put it on the defendant here, the plaintiff might be able to do nothing and just rest on the presumption that there's a price impact in the face of direct evidence that there wasn't, and then the district judge is, where Justice Alito worried about, is weighing direct evidence of no price impact versus a theory, a presumption. And I'm not sure I understand how a district judge can do that.

Your argument is that the FHFA is unconstitutionally structured given this Court's decision in Seila Law. I see vast differences between the FHFA and the F -- CFPB. The FHFA's most notable power and the reason we are here today is that they can put certain government-affiliated companies under conservatorship.

1534,35,2917.52,3036.6,Neil_Gorsuch,scotus_justice,"Good morning, Mr. Nielson. A -- a lot of your remedial argument seems to hinge on the happenstance that we had an acting director at the time of the Third Amendment's adoption. I -- I'd like to highlight two potential difficulties with that and ask for your thoughts. The first is the assumption that the acting director is answerable to the President while the director is not. Under the statute creating this outfit, the director appoints deputy directors, the director, not the President. It appears that those deputy directors would be insulated from the President therefore. And when -- when the director steps aside, he names the acting director, or, rather, he gives a pool of three of his deputies and the President chooses which of those three. But the director appointed all three of them. So I'm not sure in what sense or where we get the inference or how we generate from some penumbra emanating somewhere that the President has the removal power over this acting director. That's one. And two is, let's -- let's box in that, let's assume that's the case. So what? The -- the plaintiffs here challenged actions after -- during this whole period, including after a period in which the acting director disappeared and we now have a director. You say, well, that -- that -- that doesn't matter because the amendment is a thing that was adopted by the acting director. But the plaintiffs are challenging the director's actions as void because he is unanswerable to the President. So why wouldn't we at least be able to provide relief voiding the director's actions once we had a -- a -- a Senate-confirmed director in 2014?",19-422.wav,157,119.07999999999991,46680320,48585600,283,2.3765535774269413,0.0026049616093724,7.424074945312739,0.5111543737610841,6.964693046857993,7.089693046857993,7.264693046857993,7.473026380191326,8.914693046857993,366.0,3.07356399059456,-1.6121979270530915,0.3235945205479452,0.0772135122987428,-36.14856305277461,0.1433747410774231,31.439947735888513,18.70432681776893,116.25806451612904,62.85364464501074,3.879805791541526,0.843620324537562,0.26364712430428283,0.05737097346369653,0.05499298286476537,0.030951750107057384,7.170139834006587,0.5371047850358102,7.021646862119037,0.5345242858169144,7.32889987416723,0.5713697479195136,7.556552149936976,0.6335158926451676,7.944270021422919,0.7427118291090534,0.0032069420302018423,0.0024834478306651115,7.381275946445788,0.539818569057334,0.2848021566035529,0.2231300996110494,88.1951219512195,49.10389560446331,2.92070068777593,0.5568046312450212,-0.10321641426530621,0.5921156085090964

1558,59,5334.28,5396.12,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you. And good morning, Mr. Thompson. Picking up on the first part of Justice Gorsuch's question, the Solicitor General, in the -- the reply brief on the remedies question, starts with Marbury and says since Marbury, this Court has continued to subject structural constitutional claims to the general law of remedies that courts may deny relief on such claims as a result of estoppel, de facto officer doctrine, ratification, failure to make a timely objection, or the grant of a stay, and then says that you have cited other cases where the Court has vacated actions taken by unconstitutionally structured agencies. But the Solicitor General says those cases show only that vacatur is permissible in an appropriate case, not that it is mandatory in every case and that those principles I've just mentioned can apply.

There could be something that happened in the middle of the trial to which it's highly relevant what happened before the trial. There could be something on the list of witnesses.

1572,7,961.34,1080.34,Sonia_Sotomayor,scotus_justice,"Counsel, I think Justice Scalia would have agreed with you in his -- by his dissent in Neder. But putting that aside, I have two questions that I hope you'll get to in my time. The first is I don't know that the focus of prong 3 and prong 4 are the same. Prong 3, I think, clearly is related to the proceeding at issue: Would he have been found guilty? But prong 4 is talking more broadly about the public's perception of the judicial system as qua system. And so I don't know that the answer to your question is the same with respect to prong 3 and prong 4. I understand your argument that whether this proceeding would have been different, yes, under prong 3, and so that you may have shown prejudice, but, with respect to prong 4, I think that what the public would be looking at, qua the judge as well, is the entire proceeding. And, there, I don't see why a judge can't look at the facts of -- of a particular case from beginning to end to determine whether the public would have seen this as an injustice. And given all of the circumstances or potential circumstances, some of which are just like this case, that Justice Alito mentioned, your defendant was just released from prison six months before he was arrested for this charge, and he had served either 20 months or 36 months, it's impossible to believe that there's any reasonable doubt that he could have put his knowledge in contention.

But, on your rule, on the broad rule, the defendant can get a bare record if he just stays silent. And, you know, usually a bare record will mean reversal.

That at least has to be the theory. And the government says the Old Chief stipulation is really quite inconsistent with any such theory and prevented the government from introducing evidence about the felonies, which would, as the government says, reinforce the natural inference that the defendant was undoubtedly aware of that criminal record when he possessed the gun.

You know, you've gotten a lot of questions today pointing out the distinction between step 3 and step 4 in the plain-error analysis, you know, and Justice Alito was asking you questions about, you know, what if the defendant had written a book about his experience as a felon and on and on. In your view, do steps 3 and 4 do anything distinct? Because then the government pointed out, and I think many of the questions you've gotten show, that step 3 maybe has a jury focus, but step 4 doesn't have anything to do with what the jury would think. It has to do more with what the public would think. Do you see them as having any kind of different function or, essentially, under your analysis, we just stop at step 3 because, if it would have led to a different result, then there's no need really to do anything different in step 4?",19-8709.wav,77,49.72000000000003,27163680,27959200,167,3.358809332260658,0.004739131474247,7.985844793582885,0.2162999469499789,7.698026380191326,7.83135971352466,7.9230263801913265,8.083443046857992,8.520526380191326,191.0,3.841512469831052,-2.2173324974128223,0.2597052631578947,0.0538486710249308,-50.061823485542114,-0.1353503763675689,31.329653978892733,17.799843862992585,106.47872340425532,56.62237942497018,3.555499140059202,0.9243676618709977,0.292260531059413,0.07291140549112178,0.0695320845119844,0.047776714891189835,7.972789973571941,0.0834746696603374,7.8088183423662665,0.10863631353482803,8.069110895557756,0.08317451323940073,8.203101734801255,0.08721261969677108,8.608499193430097,0.12222809192149743,0.004759664517729163,0.0012970511412573789,8.105671568524839,0.07855932191949493,0.19323029233396308,0.030968774711040016,96.52595155709342,52.435080740223505,3.181076439793327,0.5093808420961355,-0.12663917561387159,0.5795474391623492

1667,19,1554.6,1635.16,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Thompson. I'm a bit mystified by some of the arguments here because it seems like you're asking us to reinvent the wheel, but it's not a new issue at least as I see it. We decided unanimously in 1956 how to balance property rights against union organizing rights in the Babcock case. And then, of course, in Lechmere, we reiterated that in Justice Thomas's opinion for the Court there. The Babcock briefs, if you go back into those, those are all about property rights against union organizing rights, and then Babcock considers that and -- and sets forth a rule. Now I think you -- you probably prevail under that rule, but I'm -- I'm curious why your argument is not as simple as Justice Clark's -- California Supreme Court Justice Clark's argument in his dissent in the '76 case that you cite where he just says, under Babcock, there's a rule, the Board's regulation here goes beyond the Babcock rule by permitting blanket access under private -- onto private property during worker -- working hours and access when alternative means of communications do, in fact, exist. The regulation is, therefore, unconstitutional.

That's a question of whether there's a regulatory taking and whether it went too far. This is the kind of taking that it, no matter what, requires compensation under the Fifth Amendment. It is a Fifth Amendment taking because it's a classical property interest. We have previously defined or sort of said that that kind of interest has to be a taking that is continuous and indefinite, like taking even an inch of somebody's apartment house to put up a CATV system or taking an easement for the beach. The virtue of their approach is that it's pretty clear, I think, because, otherwise, you get into the mess of saying, well, what about a year? Here, it's 4 percent of all the year's hours and 10 percent or 12 percent of all the daylight hours and -- and -- but it is not government coming in, it's a private person coming in.

It seems to me our precedent in the labor organizing context has drawn the lines and has established a very narrow and very simple resolution for this case, and I want you to tell me why it's wrong or why you disagree with it. Babcock was obviously a statutory case but informed by the Constitution explicitly, as I read it, and the question was how much access will we allow to property under the statute, the NLRA, given the constitutional backdrop of property rights? And the decision seems to reflect the Court's understanding of the Constitution and how much protection there is for property rights, at page 112 of the decision, and basically says no access unless you can show that there are no alternative means of communication that exist, to simplify what it says there.

It seems to me that the way that you're reading this statute uses authorization as an on/off switch, you know, either you're authorized to use a computer or you're not; either you're authorized to get into a particular database or get a piece of information or you're not. So, here, Van Buren could get the license plates, and it didn't matter if he was getting them for a reason that he was not supposed to get them for. So it -- it seems to me that you are looking at authorization in a -- in a bright gates up or gates down kind of way, whereas the government is looking at scope of authorization as included. So, for example, my baby-sitter might have a key to my car so she can pick up my kids from school, but then she uses the car to go run some personal errands. She's exceeded the scope of her authority. And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, why should we understand entitlement or authorization to be just an on/off switch and not to have a scope component?",19-783.wav,76,60.225000000000136,26613600,27577200,208,3.4537152345371447,0.0057477406312837,8.175659740602915,0.1607661295697072,7.919693046857993,8.073026380191326,8.148026380191327,8.25635971352466,8.593026380191327,242.0,4.018264840182639,-1.6737345183187036,0.2451120331950207,0.0398047052908869,-61.227611085150144,0.4926064908504486,31.329653978892733,17.799843862992585,106.47872340425532,56.62237942497018,3.555499140059202,0.9243676618709977,0.292260531059413,0.07291140549112178,0.0695320845119844,0.047776714891189835,7.972789973571941,0.0834746696603374,7.8088183423662665,0.10863631353482803,8.069110895557756,0.08317451323940073,8.203101734801255,0.08721261969677108,8.608499193430097,0.12222809192149743,0.004759664517729163,0.0012970511412573789,8.105671568524839,0.07855932191949493,0.19323029233396308,0.030968774711040016,96.52595155709342,52.435080740223505,3.181076439793327,0.5093808420961355,-0.12663917561387159,0.5795474391623492

You're asking us to write definitions to narrow what could otherwise be viewed as a very broad statute and dangerously vague. But more importantly to me, you said that there is no ambiguity in this statute, but let me give you an example. Imagine a law that says anyone who drives on Elm Street who is not authorized so to drive shall be punished. The ""so to drive"" to me could mean if you're not authorized to drive on Elm Street. But, under your theory, it could be and might very possibly be read as saying you can't ride on Elm Street if you're driving on it with an illegal purpose, you're speeding, you're breaking the law on curfew, you're texting. It could even cover people who drive on Elm Street on their way to commit a different crime, because they weren't authorized to be on Elm Street for the purpose of committing a crime. So, to me, if all you're relying on is that word ""so,"" I don't get around the ambiguity, especially when the other side points to so many examples in the criminal code where the ""so"" refers to the -- in the manner that has just been described.",19-783.wav,118,109.71500000000016,44268000,46023440,225,2.0507678986464906,0.0053727962993832,8.048976631728497,0.2695075825820456,7.548026380191326,7.864693046857993,8.048026380191326,8.23135971352466,8.623026380191327,251.0,2.287745522490085,-1.2398318165498043,0.4346879999999999,0.1545123266560002,-24.016876973000056,0.929854691028595,44.46467532370128,29.323536082635478,109.95065789473684,64.76436751714465,2.6200657466040966,0.5723811233062479,0.38986261995261484,0.08549628047217346,0.14846682776161488,0.0746770811751684,7.805133013963255,0.0884566789404497,7.52516015212115,0.11428521109671706,7.961307630191326,0.08851800305022046,8.1460801082615,0.0987287036854877,8.61493043720887,0.15558226283182808,0.0053205713258318785,0.0012754877286273074,7.989100632851335,0.08388340704942504,0.2658622875682973,0.037591125014008825,93.28246753246754,53.59622310714378,2.2051424364380097,0.34059064244110976,-0.024018506203511997,0.6771992073311195

And, second, if a same-sex couple ever came to Catholic Social Services, Catholic Social Services would refer that couple to another agency that works with same-sex couples so that the couple could participate and be a foster -- foster parents. And then, third, no same-sex couple has ever come to Catholic Social Services for participation in this program, and, therefore, Catholic Social Services' policy has never actually denied any same-sex couple the opportunity to be foster parents in Philadelphia.

Indeed, none has ever applied, no gay family, no gay couple. And the disagreement seems to be whether they now have to sign a piece of paper that says if there were a gay couple, we might have to look into whether they're qualified. And you're willing to have them say, but taking gay into account, you don't have to take it into account at all, but they don't want to do that. Now that seems to me a very narrow ground for deciding a case that has enormous implications. Could you not say, hey, we think if there ever were a gay couple and it really was a problem, you'd have to do something about it, like look into it and don't say gay? And they say: We don't even want to do that, but it's never come up. I mean, the natural thing for me would be to say, okay, you say what you want, we'll say what we want, and if it ever comes up, we'll deal with it. But it never has.

1782,48,4488.96,4643.84,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Good morning, Mr. Katyal. I have kind of a bigger picture thought to express, and you can react as -- as you wish. It seems like this case requires us to think about the balance between two very important rights recognized by this Court, the religious exercise and belief right, obviously, in the First Amendment, and the same-sex marriage right, as recognized in Obergefell. And it seems when those rights come into conflict, all levels of government should be careful and should often, where possible and appropriate, look for ways to accommodate both interests in reasonable ways. It's a very -- you know it's very sensitive, controversial. There are strong -- very strong feelings on all sides that warrant respect. And it seems like we and governments should be looking, where possible, for win-win answers, recognizing that neither side is going to win completely on these issues given the First Amendment on the one hand and given Obergefell on the other. But, when I look at this case, that's not at all what happened here. It seems like Philadelphia created a clash, it seems, and was looking for a fight and has brought that serious, controversial fight all the way to the Supreme Court even though no same-sex couple had gone to CSS, even though 30 agencies are available for same-sex couples, and even though CSS would refer any same-sex couple to one of those other agencies. And to be clear, I fully appreciate the stigmatic harm. I completely understand that, fully appreciate it. But we need to find a balance that also respects religious beliefs. That was the promise explicitly written by the Court in Obergefell and in Masterpiece, explicitly promised that respect for religious beliefs. And what I fear here is that the absolutist and extreme position that you're articulating would require us to go back on the promise of respect for religious believers.",19-123.wav,250,154.8800000000001,71823360,74301440,316,2.0402892561983457,0.0025122561673995,7.63291371507866,0.3512854907095951,7.281359713524659,7.448026380191326,7.548026380191326,7.681359713524659,8.844359713524659,256.0,1.65289256198347,-1.955115832864562,0.604486274509804,0.309621159615532,-12.11898332198312,1.5131672620773315,41.785141843439725,27.194327673971948,150.39492753623188,105.21289158651008,3.6720848504363617,0.9250921849183092,0.28827283278167437,0.0885866980349623,0.08267825216654537,0.05598365733477938,7.302647592312538,0.09655138904451238,7.131531228676175,0.1642337783726713,7.404602137767084,0.10076849787715361,7.537746077161023,0.145950966081457,8.134930016554963,0.4566865213451057,0.0025722081712864233,0.001067457467631925,7.447458978103783,0.11757742611642309,0.23515437131928815,0.093778177989873,106.37943262411348,70.00860142144354,2.6024435303402793,0.4200907396457913,-0.15217291260408963,0.6377656946574696

I was also concerned with what Justice Thomas brought up, and so, to clear away some weeds from my mind, would you tell me where I missed this or if I'm right. We're looking at a statute, 141. A says the Secretary shall take a Decennial Census, okay? B says the tabulation of the population that he just took, as required for the apportionment of representatives, that tabulation shall be reported to the Secretary -- by the Secretary to the President. That's the report we're concerned about. That's the tabulation we're concerned about. And it is based on that, where you go to 2a, the President shall transmit a statement showing the whole number of persons for the purpose, again, of apportionment. So we're not interested in other ways. We're interested in this report, in this tabulation, under 141(b). Now, if I'm right so far, the President's order says I'll tell you why I want that. I want that because it's our policy that illegal aliens will not be included in the census. I can't tell you exactly what ones. It doesn't say that. It just says illegal aliens will not be included. And he asked for the report so he can do that. Now, if the Constitution forbids him to, or if the statutes forbid him to, subtract from the tabulation for purposes of the statement, if it forbids him to subtract those illegal aliens, or to the extent it does, the tabulation and the report are not the tabulation required for the apportionment of the census and, therefore, he cannot ask -- he cannot ask the Secretary for that report to contain that information.

1812,10,916.72,1017.12,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr,scotus_justice,"General Wall, if I can, I want to try to press you a little bit on some of the answers you gave to the Chief Justice because I find the posture of this case quite frustrating. It could be that we are dealing with a possibility that is quite important. It could be that this is much ado about very little. It depends on what the Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce are able to do. If I just take the numbers from the district court in D.C.'s opinion last week, they said that the -- the plaintiffs in that case were claiming that there are 10.5 million people in this country who would be counted as being here illegally. But, if you look at the smaller number of -- of those who are held in detention facilities, it's -- it's something like 60,000. The first number could easily change the apportionment of representatives. The second one, it's much more doubtful that it would change the apportionment of representatives.

And what -- what is the government's view about the status of Section 2? New York suggests, well, maybe it is repealed, but to the extent the government wishes to comply with the repealed statute, it has to follow the repealed statute's terms, as one response.

First of all, you're not saying, as to judicial review, not now, not ever. You're just saying not now as I understand it. But, as Justice Breyer indicated, the posture of this will change after the President transmits the statement, and there's a question about injunctive relief against the President. So I think you're saying that we can assume, as the Court has before, that the President would comply by a declaratory judgment requiring him to transmit calculations that include those non-citizens living -- living unlawfully within the country if we were to issue such an order after the President transmits the statement.

Back when this one was passed, we had a pretty free-wheeling approach. You know, we weren't as confined to the specific language. You sort of looked at what Congress had in mind and -- and figured out the meaning in light of that. And, of course, today, we have a more disciplined approach, you know, I think more suited to our role under the Constitution. But shouldn't we construe this statute in the environment in which Congress passed it in light of the, as I said, more free-wheeling approach? And I think there'd be a lot more leeway to your friend on the other side argument about an expansive reading of some of the language.

They can't both be right, that's right. All right. You see that's the old joke, but that's where I am. So I'm pretty familiar with the arguments and I see which way do we go, and the argument, it seems to me, that's against you -- and I'll put the other half to the other side. The argument that's against you is simply this to me: Law isn't perfect. Courts make mistakes. We make mistakes too.

1883,21,2287.43500005,2444.98500005,Stephen_G_Breyer,scotus_justice,"History matters. I think Justice Brandeis, when he started, was faced with a business community that was very suspicious of the FTC's power and thought it would be abused and a progressive community that thought it's absolutely necessary to bring bad business practices under control. So they compromised. The compromise was you've got to do what the FTC says, but before it tells you to do something, it will find that what you're doing now is wrong. It will find that. It will be a cease-and-desist order, later expanded under Moss-Magnuson, I think, to include violation of a rule. So Section 5, cease-and-desist order or violation of a rule, ha, damage of some kind. Nineteen, the same thing. And now we have right in the middle 13, no protection like that whatsoever. Do not worry, says the FTC, we will only use it in exceptional cases. Ha! In 2012, they repeal that. And now, 10 years later, after this has been in effect for a few years, I read that 100 cases under this provision are in the courts, compared with 10 or 12 under the regular cases. And you say it's just obvious, we're going to get those people who think their bad conduct is obvious. Look at Skechers. Look at the Cardinal case. Go back to the famous Unburn case. Add substantiation. People wouldn't know that it is an unfair practice that a chiropractor who was married to a wife who had some income from the company and therefore is a conclusion as to the muscle toning of the company should be discounted. And that's the kind of case they're bringing now. Now do you see my point? On the one hand, it's well-established law in the lower court. On the other hand, if we interpret it your way, we -- we -- we say your fears, business community, were absolutely right. It is now up to the FTC. Before you know the thing is wrong, they hit you with bad damages. This case? Perhaps you're right. But Skechers, Cardinal, even Unburn, build strong bodies eight ways, that was Wonder Bread. They only did it six ways. I mean, you see, it's giving the FTC -- that -- that -- you get my point.

1893,31,3354.24,3456.4,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Marcus. Good to be with you again. I want to pick up on Justice Alito's question and Mr. FitzGerald's article, which I've read. You obviously put forward good arguments on Porter and the Court's precedent and Congress's intent, as well as the body of court of appeals cases, but it seems that the problem you have is the text. And in that sense, this case really is a separation of powers case. I -- I -- I worked in the Executive Branch for many years, so I understand how this happens. When you're in the Executive Branch or an independent agency, you want to do good things and prevent or punish bad things, and sometimes your statutory authority is borderline. And it could be war policy or immigration or environmental or what have you, but with good intentions, the agency pushes the envelope and stretches the statutory language to do the good or prevent the bad. The problem is -- is it results in a transfer of power from Congress to the Executive Branch to decide whether to exercise this new authority. That's a particular concern, at least for me, with independent agencies. So -- now why isn't the answer here, for the agency to seek this new authority from Congress, for us to maintain the principle that separation of powers, that the agency should stick to the authority in the -- in the text and not -- and not go beyond that? A 30,000-foot question.

1901,5,530.8,673.4,Stephen_G_Breyer,scotus_justice,"Now I also think that First Options rests heavily and basically repeats AT&T, so I've read AT&T about five times. What it seems to say is, if you have a question, parties, or one of them, whether this dispute falls under the terms of the contract that have arbitration for 1 -- paragraphs 1 through 7 or is rather a Section 10 dispute, where there is no arbitration clearly, you don't know if it's a Section 8 or a Section 10, well, what happens? What AT&T says is, but that is a question of arbitrability. It is a question whether this dispute is arbitrable. So it's for the judge. But where there is an arbitration clause in the contract, as there was in First Options as far as the owners knew, but where there is a -- where there is an arbitration clause, then there is a presumption of arbitrability. All right? So that seems to me, Judge, you decide. You decide whether this particular dispute is sent to an arbitrator or -- or for the court, i.e., is it arbitrable, you decide, Judge, but if there's an arbitration clause in the contract, you decide with the presumption of arbitrability that it will normally be arbitrable. That's what it seems to say. And so the judge was right to decide it below, but he didn't decide it right because he should have given it a presumption of arbitrability. Now that's how I read those two cases, but also in the back of my mind is what in heaven's name happens in labor arbitration. In the ordinary labor arbitration case -- and that's where all this law comes from -- where -- one party, the labor union, says this is a Section 8 agreement, arbitrate it. No, says the employer. It is a Section 10 kind of situation grievance and, therefore, it falls within the exception, don't arbitrate it. How do they decide that?

As I understand it, it goes like this: First, we have a presumption that's in favor of arbitration. Then we have an exception to that presumption, which is the First Options rule. When the matter deals with arbitrability, we actually presume that the Court is supposed to decide those gateway questions. So, for whatever reason, we have those presumptions. The Court has said many times that we have those presumptions. Then, as I understand what the Petitioner is saying, he's saying, now let's add a third presumption. The third presumption is, if we see evidence of any delegation, then we should assume that the parties meant to delegate all arbitrability questions. So, if there's any delegation of arbitrability, there's complete delegation of arbitrability. That's the presumption. And he says that presumption should operate because it wouldn't make sense to do partial delegations of arbitrability.

1937,41,3459.4,3575.96,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And, Mr. Geyser, good afternoon. First, picking up on Justice Sotomayor's questions on the incorporation of the AAA rules, you -- that's not the issue before us, but just to pause on that for a second, you referred to it as an elephant in a mouse hole. But it's really an elephant in an elephant hole. When you look at the AAA rules, Rule 7(a) says, ""the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim."" That's very broad language, which is probably why every court of appeals to address this said that the AAA rules are an express delegation. But, again, we don't have to decide that here. That's just the premise. But I wanted to just pause on the elephant in -- in a mouse hole point. Here's -- here's the problem I think I have with your argument, and you've made it very cleverly and persuasively, but the problem is that you are suggesting that the way parties divide up arbitration -- namely, some subjects will be subject to arbitration and decided by an arbitrator and some subjects won't -- also applies to the question of who decides arbitrability. So courts will decide whether certain things are arbitrable or not, and arbitrators will decide whether other things are arbitrable. I think that's what you're saying. But that's just not how it works in the real world, nor could it realistically work that way in the real world. I don't think any contract says arbitrability shall be -- of certain subjects shall be decided by the arbitrator and others -- of other subjects by the court. Can you help me on that?

It lists two activities, ""storing or producing telephone numbers,"" followed by a modifying phrase, ""using a random or sequential number generator."" People make statements like that all the time, and, you know what, those who hear them or read them understand what they mean without looking at treatises on grammar syntax, usage, or interpretation. And the way they do that is to ask, what makes sense? I can give you lots of examples, but I have very little time for questioning, so they -- they ask about the sense of it before they get to all this arcane stuff. So the question that jumps out here is this: Does it make any sense to speak about storing a list of telephone numbers using a random or sequential number generator? And the best answer I can find in the briefs on your side is that there were systems that produced lists of numbers using such a generator and then stored them. But, unless you can explain how a generator was used in the very process of storing the numbers, I think you have a problem.",19-511.wav,29,80.67999999999995,8483840,9774720,205,2.540902330193358,0.0051548637361639,7.604167646718814,0.4465194490845123,6.886026380191326,7.293859713524659,7.539693046857993,7.95635971352466,8.535026380191326,181.0,2.243430837878038,-1.7566856039342351,0.4446222222222222,0.1408397906172841,-26.983193383197364,0.2289397120475769,35.177049469081275,18.167109216140013,95.2690909090909,45.71811789558996,2.7815072068155478,0.6326351832644984,0.36861430167853837,0.08379884919153073,0.11033019250911293,0.0543963935874066,7.187024251237555,0.14144256594555582,6.97135484734461,0.16710109796171438,7.3548238254468,0.17424392059415778,7.600330212308115,0.2547982108901217,8.401194263403005,0.42156010250370535,0.0043786502521027506,0.001931427510143299,7.440229568872157,0.17357454826065932,0.36484100882161585,0.11326622023216541,83.12014134275618,41.37580387230249,2.422595359426968,0.41004469303672064,-0.2356690736602689,0.7367765817651246

But I think that the point that Mr. Clement might make here is that the meaning here is not so impossible. You know, there's a little bit of awkwardness about saying that a number generator stores numbers, but, actually, that can be explained by looking at the kinds of dialing devices that existed at the time, where there were devices that generated numbers for immediate dialing and devices that stored numbers for later dialing.

In -- in response to Justice Alito, you were talking about what happens if -- if we were to interpret the statute your way. And I guess I'm still a little unclear about the answer there.

Others have worried about our -- our contemporary cell phones that can do that. But even in -- at the time of the statute's adoption, there were phones that captured numbers that had been dialed and you could press redial.

2002,8,634.04,694.12,Stephen_G_Breyer,scotus_justice,"Less than five minutes, okay. Thank you. And a -- a second question is a legal question which I'm having a hard time with. Sure, I think you could apply exigent circumstances. Then I think, wait a minute, there -- there's so many situations where it's obvious the police should enter. You know, a baby's been crying for five hours, nobody seems to be around. A rat's come out of the house at a time when rats carry serious disease and have to be stopped. A person goes into the house that the police think, but they think the -- go inside the house and don't know that this person has a serious communicable disease, particularly for older people who happen to live in the house.

2037,43,3173.32,3306.56,Sonia_Sotomayor,scotus_justice,"Counsel, I think that Justice Alito hit the nail on the head, because I've read the decisions of other circuits. They seem all to have different factors that make up community caretaking, and I'm actually not sure what it means. But I am concerned deeply about the First Circuit's claim that there is no requirement that officers must select the least intrusive means of fulfilling care -- community caretaking responsibilities. I think what everyone has forgotten here is that, at least in this situation, there was no immediate danger to the person threatening suicide and no immediate danger to the wife because the suicide person was removed to a hospital. And so the issue is, can the police, notwithstanding that and notwithstanding the ability to ask the wife whether she would consent to giving up the gun and ammunition, that they decided on their own to go in and seize the gun. That appears to me to take away from any of the limiting principles that Justice Alito put forth, yes, some -- some -- whether you call it reasonable suspicion, some -- some suspicion, whatever adjective you put there, there was no immediate danger, there were a readily accessible alternative that was ignored, and you're putting into the hands of law enforcement the ability to use their judgment as opposed to that of the psychiatrists who were treating this man, they certainly could have asked the psychiatrists whether they should remove the guns or not.

Picking up right there on Justice Gorsuch's question does make this seem, as I think the amicus brief from the states, written by the Utah solicitor general, says that this case is before the Court, as the brief says, ""partly because of a confusion in nomenclature.""

2053,59,4622.36,4749.12,Sonia_Sotomayor,scotus_justice,"Counsel, one of the reasons I think the Fourth Amendment was there was to make persons -- and I'm quoting its own language roughly -- to secure persons in their home. That's the language of the Fourth Amendment. And it seems to me that I don't have a problem with them having removed this gentleman and taken him to the hospital. That's a seizure, because they had reason to believe that he was threatening suicide. And even though 12 hours had passed, the wife was still concerned, and he admitted to the threat by calling it a joke. I don't think police officers have to take his description at face value given the circumstances described. So seizing him and taking him to the home would seem to me -- to psychiatric examination as very much an exigent circumstance. Missing here, as I pointed out to your colleague, is the next step, which is going into the home without attempt to secure consent from the wife and seizing the gun and then keeping it indefinitely until a lawsuit is filed. The wife tried to get it back. He tried to get it back. Weeks and weeks went by. When we permit police to search and seize without some standard, we run the risk of situations like this one repeating themselves. So can you concentrate on the exigency with respect to the second seizure at issue? My colleagues seem concerned with the first one, preventing the suicide, which has to do with seizing the individual or even going in to care for the individual.

But, when the City hears about a particular case and thinks that it's a -- let's say it's a particularly valuable car and thinks that there's a real danger that the owner is going to do just that, going to go -- go there and drive off with the car, the City relocates that car to a different location where it's subject to 24-hour guard. Would that be an alteration of the status quo?",19-357.wav,37,54.200000000000045,9118720,9985920,137,2.527675276752765,0.0063646848481057,7.432964651796264,0.6178557351805547,6.774359713524659,7.03135971352466,7.173026380191326,7.639693046857992,8.973026380191326,238.0,4.39114391143911,-2.452344169606341,0.2277805907172995,0.0549101290747566,-68.18562202203778,-0.1444034725427627,35.177049469081275,18.167109216140013,95.2690909090909,45.71811789558996,2.7815072068155478,0.6326351832644984,0.36861430167853837,0.08379884919153073,0.11033019250911293,0.0543963935874066,7.187024251237555,0.14144256594555582,6.97135484734461,0.16710109796171438,7.3548238254468,0.17424392059415778,7.600330212308115,0.2547982108901217,8.401194263403005,0.42156010250370535,0.0043786502521027506,0.001931427510143299,7.440229568872157,0.17357454826065932,0.36484100882161585,0.11326622023216541,83.12014134275618,41.37580387230249,2.422595359426968,0.41004469303672064,-0.2356690736602689,0.7367765817651246

It is something that the Court has said multiple times, and mostly it makes complete sense. But I -- I -- I wonder whether you're confusing a means and an end, that the real function of an automatic stay is to consolidate the estate so that it can be redistributed.

And 542 says just the same thing. 542 says shall turn it over. And then there's some exceptions in 542. But, for the most part, you -- you -- you read those into 363, except I don't know what happens to life insurance, but -- and in both cases, I guess, if -- if -- if you're right and the City needs protection, it can say: Judge, we're ready to give him the car, but please give us protection.

So you -- you told several of my colleagues that the recognition clause -- that one way to understand it is that it's a term of art but that it has a -- well, that you could take its ordinary meaning, simply, you know, an entity that contracts with the federal government for services that are designed to go to Indians because of their status as Indians. And you said, well, sure, you can look at this, and I understand it's your backup argument, but you can understand it in its ordinary meaning as the other Petitioner advocates for. Now you say but a lesser-included definition would be the term-of-art recognition definition like we see in the later-passed List Act. I don't really see how you can have a -- a lesser included specialized definition. It seems to me either it's ordinary meaning or it's not. And, you know, you're kind of cagey in your brief and I think a little bit at oral argument too about whether, in fact, that eligibility clause refers to FRT status. So which is it?

It only existed in the 1990s. So 45 years ago, in 1974 -- is my math right -- when ISDA was passed, there was no term of art that you were recognized as a government body. So now what you're arguing, I think, is that's clear today when the CARES Act was passed, but, as Justice Alito just pointed out, then why would Congress have bothered to include ANCs in the CARE Act at all since, after 45 years, it clearly knows now that no ANC has ever been politically recognized? Now I think the government's absurdity -- absurdity argument has more force because, in 45 years, not a one -- if we accept what the D.C. Circuit said, that in 1974 it was uncertain whether some would be recognized politically, it's clear now it's not going to be.

So you said there is because Congress in the future could have recognized ANCs. Justice Alito said to you it had never done that in the past.

2158,48,5170.16,5251.0,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Rasmussen. I want to give you an opportunity to respond to how I think the two statutory arguments on the other side merge potentially. So it seems to me, if we start with the text and we look at ""recognized as eligible,"" we have a choice. Do we read that in its ordinary meaning, as Mr. Clement says, or do we read it as a term of art? And that's a choice we have, and we have to figure out, how do we resolve that? And one of the ways we usually resolve that is looking at the context to see how Congress might have been using the phrase here.

But, if DHS really can't coordinate with, you know, immigration courts because it can't put things on their docket, it may have no choice, you know, if the software doesn't handle things in every situation, but to give a date that it hopes for, but this rule would force them to put that date down. Let me -- let me go back to Justice Kagan's question. So she pointed out that another way to satisfy this rule would be to send essentially what would be a draft notice containing all information except time and place the first time around, and then later, once the time and place was set, send the notice that would actually trigger the stop-time rule that contained all the information. And you conceded that would be sufficient, but you resisted it. And I'm wondering why you're resisting it, because wouldn't it be better under Justice Kagan's hypothetical for the immigrant to have more information and to know in the beginning, well, this is what's coming? We're going to be initiating, you know, removal proceedings based on this information, and you can expect to hear the time and date late -- later, and that's when the stop-time rule will -- will happen.

It says a notice of appeal -- a notice -- a notice to appear must include these six or seven or eight items, and that's what entitles you to the benefit the statute confers against the alien and on the government.

You were talking about this in response to some questions by Justice Thomas. And you said, in that case, you have to issue the NTA immediately, within 48 hours, but you don't necessarily know at that point where the detention facility will be. So here's my question. I mean, presumably, now you're handling that by, within 48 hours, issuing a notice to appear that has all information except the time and the place of the hearing.

In Bennett, we held that biological opinions, while technically advisory, have ""a powerful coercive effect"" on the action of the agency. Why is it that a draft jeopardy opinion doesn't have the same coercive effect? As I think the Ninth Circuit pointed out, what was at issue was the November rule that the EPA was proposing, and the draft that was sent to the EPA made them change their mind. They did something completely different. With respect to the decision relating to that November action, the draft opinion did exactly what a final opinion is intended to do. So I -- I understand your basic argument that it wasn't clear the agency's final decisionmaker had accepted that that was the jeopardy opinion they were going to get, but I go back to Justice Thomas's question. If that agency head was about to sign it and said, ah, I'll -- I'm just going to send it to them and tell them I'll sign it on -- on Monday, I don't want to go into the office on Sunday, it would be your argument that that wouldn't be a final opinion worthy of disclosure?",19-547.wav,34,101.68999999999994,14273760,15900800,203,1.9962631527190493,0.0045168720981748,8.088047325732918,0.2446615528520761,7.598026380191326,7.931359713524659,8.073026380191326,8.248026380191327,8.63135971352466,206.0,2.025764578621301,-2.273902814114789,0.4859317073170731,0.2381122489946461,-16.497154596965025,0.0971123650670051,44.46467532370128,29.323536082635478,109.95065789473684,64.76436751714465,2.6200657466040966,0.5723811233062479,0.38986261995261484,0.08549628047217346,0.14846682776161488,0.0746770811751684,7.805133013963255,0.0884566789404497,7.52516015212115,0.11428521109671706,7.961307630191326,0.08851800305022046,8.1460801082615,0.0987287036854877,8.61493043720887,0.15558226283182808,0.0053205713258318785,0.0012754877286273074,7.989100632851335,0.08388340704942504,0.2658622875682973,0.037591125014008825,93.28246753246754,53.59622310714378,2.2051424364380097,0.34059064244110976,-0.024018506203511997,0.6771992073311195

What emerges from Step 2 is what it will issue 97 percent of the time. And what emerges from Step 3 is the final product. Now at what point do you think a document would become non-privileged?",19-547.wav,124,58.19499999999971,43606720,44537840,121,2.0792164275281486,0.0046187252423524,7.426253330545936,0.3177569703857983,6.95635971352466,7.198026380191326,7.38135971352466,7.606359713524659,8.15635971352466,205.0,3.5226394020104994,-2.6276053133870043,0.2745098039215686,0.0663780146097655,-73.9623835162228,0.0460598431527614,35.177049469081275,18.167109216140013,95.2690909090909,45.71811789558996,2.7815072068155478,0.6326351832644984,0.36861430167853837,0.08379884919153073,0.11033019250911293,0.0543963935874066,7.187024251237555,0.14144256594555582,6.97135484734461,0.16710109796171438,7.3548238254468,0.17424392059415778,7.600330212308115,0.2547982108901217,8.401194263403005,0.42156010250370535,0.0043786502521027506,0.001931427510143299,7.440229568872157,0.17357454826065932,0.36484100882161585,0.11326622023216541,83.12014134275618,41.37580387230249,2.422595359426968,0.41004469303672064,-0.2356690736602689,0.7367765817651246

So the -- the need for that, I think, is multi-pronged. First, the agency officials who are engaged in deliberations need to be able to speak with candor, as Justice Gorsuch was just saying. Second, FOIA officers, who are rampant throughout the executive branch, spend an enormous amount of time and resources on FOIA, could use clarity. And then district court judges in the District of Columbia and elsewhere, if you talk to, would lament the lack of clarity and clear rules in -- in FOIA cases. So that raises the concern that the effects-based test or looking at the effects of the memo could become so fact-intensive and could really blur the longstanding predecisional principle of the deliberative process privilege because lots of drafts have -- have real effects within the executive branch.

And the government and Mississippi contest that understanding, and I want to get your reaction to their arguments. What the government says is that all this talk about incorrigibles, that's just really a label for the final judgment that a court reaches after it considers youth during sentencing.

So let me ask you this: When the sentencing scheme is discretionary, won't the judge necessarily consider youth and, in particular, because defense counsel will invariably raise the defendant's youth as a reason not to impose life without parole, and -- and even apart from that, that will be the common sense of the situation when you're dealing with someone who committed a crime at 15, as we have here, that you'll be considering that. That'll really be the centerpiece, you would think, in most cases. So, when the judge then determines that the sentence should be life without parole, won't the judge necessarily have made that informal finding or that judgment or that conclusion that you're seeking?",18-1259.wav,65,49.56000000000017,31107440,31900400,119,2.4011299435028164,0.0024597195095486,7.346340445701924,0.1268345136325447,7.051693046857993,7.289693046857993,7.348026380191326,7.406359713524659,7.606359713524659,154.0,3.107344632768351,-2.3146269284723715,0.3183267973856208,0.0892391350335344,-34.54295136978971,0.3649463057518005,41.785141843439725,27.194327673971948,150.39492753623188,105.21289158651008,3.6720848504363617,0.9250921849183092,0.28827283278167437,0.0885866980349623,0.08267825216654537,0.05598365733477938,7.302647592312538,0.09655138904451238,7.131531228676175,0.1642337783726713,7.404602137767084,0.10076849787715361,7.537746077161023,0.145950966081457,8.134930016554963,0.4566865213451057,0.0025722081712864233,0.001067457467631925,7.447458978103783,0.11757742611642309,0.23515437131928815,0.093778177989873,106.37943262411348,70.00860142144354,2.6024435303402793,0.4200907396457913,-0.15217291260408963,0.6377656946574696

I don't really understand exactly what we are talking about. There are a lot of statements in Miller and Montgomery, and one of them, which a lot of the argument has focused on, is the statement that a judge has to determine whether a particular defendant's crime, a particular minor's crime reflects transient immaturity or incorrigibility, as if those are the opposite sides of the -- of the same coin. But they're not. A crime could reflect transient -- a -- a -- a crime could reflect transient immaturity. A person -- a -- a minor could be completely mature and yet capable of being rehabilitated.

So merely considering youth can't be enough under Montgomery. It established that the penological justification for life without parole collapsed in light of the distinct -- distinctive attributes of youth. More than once, it says: ""Even if a court considers a child's age before sentencing him or her to a lifetime in prison, that sentence still violates the Eighth Amendment for a child whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity."" Proportionality of sentencing looks at the nature of the crime. But Miller and Montgomery made very clear that we're looking at the nature of the offender.

Mr. Shapiro said we shouldn't analogize this situation to Lockett in the death penalty context but, rather, to Atkins and Ford and consider this, in essence, an eligibility requirement with a finding of some kind, not just a process that considers youth as a factor. And that raises, of course, the tension that Justice Kagan was identifying in Montgomery. And I think what she was getting at is that the key paragraph in Montgomery that says no finding of fact is required is, some would say, in tension with the conclusion that Miller was a substantive rule. Okay? And so, if that's true -- and you've made an attempt to reconcile it, and I think you make a -- a good point on that.

If the process was good and perfect, my understanding is that you can't raise a different Eighth Amendment argument that the individual sentence was still disproportionate. The answer to that is the process is what leads to the proportionality, at least as an Eighth Amendment matter. And by analogy, in the death penalty context, the Gregg versus Georgia context, we have said proportionality is required, but it's achieved in two ways. One, you rule out the death penalty or life without parole for a certain class of offenses or offenders. And, secondly, we require that the sentencer consider all the relevant mitigating and other relevant circumstances. That's the Lockett principle. And, here, I just want to make sure of your answer. If the -- if the process considers all the relevant circumstances, is there a separate argument, as an Eighth Amendment matter, that someone could still make, well, they applied all the relevant factors, but I still think it's disproportionate?",18-1259.wav,199,75.11000005000005,76585039,77786800,180,2.3964851535105263,0.0019815249100114,7.500190122881385,0.1938986403768432,7.264693046857993,7.389693046857993,7.464693046857993,7.548026380191326,7.98535971352466,218.0,2.902409797029415,-2.289494815786038,0.3409400921658986,0.1011876139225721,-28.551054150971623,-0.1586019992828369,41.785141843439725,27.194327673971948,150.39492753623188,105.21289158651008,3.6720848504363617,0.9250921849183092,0.28827283278167437,0.0885866980349623,0.08267825216654537,0.05598365733477938,7.302647592312538,0.09655138904451238,7.131531228676175,0.1642337783726713,7.404602137767084,0.10076849787715361,7.537746077161023,0.145950966081457,8.134930016554963,0.4566865213451057,0.0025722081712864233,0.001067457467631925,7.447458978103783,0.11757742611642309,0.23515437131928815,0.093778177989873,106.37943262411348,70.00860142144354,2.6024435303402793,0.4200907396457913,-0.15217291260408963,0.6377656946574696

So, if Congress tied -- or the Senate, you know, in -- in the bill that Congress passed, has tied its own hands in that way, it would seem unusual that in the same breath, by using non-immigrant status, Congress intended to delegate to the executive much broader authority to treat TPS -- those in TPS status as eligible for LPR status based only on the word ""non-immigrant.""

2402,37,4144.84,4240.04,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Good morning, Ms. Harrington. I think you agree that forum non conveniens survives the FSIA, so I take from that that the FSIA would not displace comity if a comity doctrine exists and existed at the time. And you've made important arguments, as have Professors Dodge and Gardner, that the doctrine doesn't exist. And I understand those, but put those aside for now. If the doctrine does exist, then the question's how to apply it. And I did not view it necessarily, again, assuming it exists, as requiring a case-by-case foreign policy or international friction evaluation. In part for reasons others have expressed, that would not be predictable. It would be hard for courts to do that, wouldn't necessarily be equitable, given the number of courts who would be involved hearing similarly situated plaintiffs. Rather, I viewed the doctrine at least as it's been articulated as reflecting a general foreign policy concern, and then the question becomes the particulars of the doctrine. And I had understood the argument to be that, if foreign defendants harm foreign parties in a foreign country and remedies are available in the foreign country, then American courts should usually abstain. So, again, if the doctrine exists, what is the problem with that kind of fairly bright-line principle that would not require a case-by-case evaluation of foreign policy interests?",18-1447.wav,241,95.19999999999982,66317440,67840640,223,2.3424369747899205,0.0019373911916473,7.294780256160319,0.1624899385212382,7.048026380191327,7.189693046857993,7.264693046857993,7.356359713524659,7.75635971352466,388.0,4.075630252100848,-2.063428671016446,0.2451679586563307,0.0643099950457038,-48.61836328035436,0.3782607316970825,41.785141843439725,27.194327673971948,150.39492753623188,105.21289158651008,3.6720848504363617,0.9250921849183092,0.28827283278167437,0.0885866980349623,0.08267825216654537,0.05598365733477938,7.302647592312538,0.09655138904451238,7.131531228676175,0.1642337783726713,7.404602137767084,0.10076849787715361,7.537746077161023,0.145950966081457,8.134930016554963,0.4566865213451057,0.0025722081712864233,0.001067457467631925,7.447458978103783,0.11757742611642309,0.23515437131928815,0.093778177989873,106.37943262411348,70.00860142144354,2.6024435303402793,0.4200907396457913,-0.15217291260408963,0.6377656946574696

2408,2,484.42,607.61999995,Stephen_G_Breyer,scotus_justice,"All right. I -- we all have the same question, I guess. Mine is the same as Justice Thomas and the Chief Justice, but let me try to put it less accurately than they did in simpler -- and directly. Look, the -- the ratio between crack and ordinary cocaine was ridiculous, 100 to 1 or something. So Congress finally got around to modifying that. Fine. And anybody who had been sentenced under the old range, go back and get resentenced. Fine. The problem is, what has this section got to do with it, (C)? Because this section seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with that ratio. It punishes people for 20 years or for 30 years if they commit a felony, for example, of any drug, Schedule I, Schedule II, plus two others, any drug, any of those drugs with intent to distribute it. It had nothing to do with the ratio. And if you look at the guideline, which is Level 34 for a career criminal, section -- category 6, that has nothing to do with it. That only -- not only picks up all the people who twice committed that felony, the crack one, and also people who twice committed many forms of robbery and twice committed. So, if you win this case, I don't see what's to prevent any person -- any person certainly who convicted of any drug felony, career criminal, from going out and asking, Judge, resentence me. Now that's the practical problem I have, as well as the language not really applying. You get me out of this. I'd love to get out of it. I mean, I think they were much too high. I understand that.

Now let's take Mr. Terry, who was a career offender, I take it. He had several prior convictions for drugs. And we look at (C), and when we look at (C), and this is before the modification, we look at (C), we see that he possessed with intent to distribute. He had prior convictions for the same thing. And, therefore, he falls within the second sentence, 30-year maximum. Then we look to the guidelines. The guidelines say a career offender -- that's what he was -- is sentenced at level 34, category 6. Okay? Now he was sentenced at level 34, category 6 with some modifications to get the sentence down. That's a very high level. Now let's imagine Mr. Terry being sentenced exactly the same way after the change. Why would there be a difference? The only difference could be in the propensity of the judge to depart from the guidelines, to depart downward. And I don't see why. This statute punishes people who are career offenders as applied to him, whether it's methamphetamine, whether it's cocaine, or whether it's crack. And why would the sentence be different, the one from the other, in respect to drugs, whether it's one drug or the other?

I think that's true in many cases, but then how do you link that up to the statutory text?",20-5904.wav,168,44.94999999999982,44954400,45673600,98,2.1802002224694195,0.0018382832554812,7.338224998498751,0.3269454913791462,6.981359713524659,7.164693046857993,7.264693046857993,7.4230263801913265,8.460359713524658,125.0,2.78086763070079,-1.6087649414820488,0.3517419354838709,0.1196840624349636,-34.985286010607936,-0.8437638878822327,41.785141843439725,27.194327673971948,150.39492753623188,105.21289158651008,3.6720848504363617,0.9250921849183092,0.28827283278167437,0.0885866980349623,0.08267825216654537,0.05598365733477938,7.302647592312538,0.09655138904451238,7.131531228676175,0.1642337783726713,7.404602137767084,0.10076849787715361,7.537746077161023,0.145950966081457,8.134930016554963,0.4566865213451057,0.0025722081712864233,0.001067457467631925,7.447458978103783,0.11757742611642309,0.23515437131928815,0.093778177989873,106.37943262411348,70.00860142144354,2.6024435303402793,0.4200907396457913,-0.15217291260408963,0.6377656946574696

Think of the first. Was that person, on your reading, prevented from asking for a lower sentence? Now, remember, the AUSA thought these high sentences are ridiculous, so the AUSA brought it under (C) and not (A) and (B) and said we don't know how much drugs there are, but the judge found out in the pre-sentence report and used the table. Can that person challenge his sentence? Yes. Why? Not under this statute, but because the Sentencing Commission reduced his sentence to reflect the change in the First Step Act. So he's free, all those people, to be resentenced. Now what about the second sentence? The second sentence has to do with career offenders. They aren't free to rechallenge because they were not sentenced under the sentencing guidelines having to do with drugs. They were sentenced under the sentencing guideline having to do with career offenders.

2451,45,4299.365,4449.03,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Mortara. Picking up on Justice Kagan's questions, if the statutory text is ambiguous, given the cross-reference, it seems to me that the other side is asking us to look at a few things or maybe there are a few things that could be considered in how to think about this statute, and I just want to get your reaction to these things. And so one is the, you know, relatively small amount. Justice Sotomayor alluded to this. I asked about the cost. Fifty dollars. And assume it's a few hundred dollars, it's still a low amount that we're talking about here, not the kind of situation that I think most -- most people have in mind when they think about lengthy sentences for -- for federal sentencing. So that's one. Two is the history of the disparity, the crack powder disparity. This all kind of stems to June 19, 1986, when Len Bias died, and that was a shocking event, particularly in this area, particularly for those of us who -- you know, I was a year younger than he was, looked up to him, like everyone in this area did, and that was a shocking event in this area and -- and ultimately in the country at large and prompted Congress, along with other things, but that was really the proximate cause of Congress moving to establish the 100-to-1 ratio, even though that was a powder situation in the Len Bias situation, the 100-to-1 disparity is ushered into the law, and then there are racial disparities, of course, that develop over time, and Congress really has been working now for 35 years hearing about this and working to claw that back. So that -- that's something we should be thinking about, I think the other side would say. And then the third, which we've touched on, is the reality of sentencing judges and how they really, in practice -- I take Justice Breyer's point that some of them in some cases are going to think differently about this when they're close to the limit of five versus not close to the 28. So those three things together, to -- to the extent the statute's ambiguous, low amount, the history, the racial disparities, and the reality of sentencing, and you can take whatever time you want to answer those.",20-5904.wav,247,149.66499999999996,68789840,71184480,397,2.6525907860889326,0.0021573838956221,7.423923143095964,0.2043799235274143,7.173026380191326,7.314693046857993,7.406359713524659,7.481359713524659,7.832693046857994,488.0,3.260615374336018,-1.620701965632408,0.3068583162217659,0.0846868279749885,-20.569312358860465,0.472710371017456,41.785141843439725,27.194327673971948,150.39492753623188,105.21289158651008,3.6720848504363617,0.9250921849183092,0.28827283278167437,0.0885866980349623,0.08267825216654537,0.05598365733477938,7.302647592312538,0.09655138904451238,7.131531228676175,0.1642337783726713,7.404602137767084,0.10076849787715361,7.537746077161023,0.145950966081457,8.134930016554963,0.4566865213451057,0.0025722081712864233,0.001067457467631925,7.447458978103783,0.11757742611642309,0.23515437131928815,0.093778177989873,106.37943262411348,70.00860142144354,2.6024435303402793,0.4200907396457913,-0.15217291260408963,0.6377656946574696

2480,25,2345.92,2434.04,Stephen_G_Breyer,scotus_justice,"I'm curious to know what you think of -- of Professor Stephanopoulos's test. My reason is simply this: It seems to me that in many discrimination statutes -- anti-discrimination, Title VII, Title VI, the Housing Act, the age discrimination -- essentially, the courts have come down in disparate impact situations to three elements. First, the plaintiff has to show that there is some kind of significant disparity. Second, the plaintiff has to show that there is at least a but-for cause and the state's or the employer's policy is the but-for cause.

She says in response to your argument that we have to look at the process itself to say, overall, is the process, you know, open enough for disadvantaged voters. So, you know, even if they can't send their ballot in via ballot collection, they have many other opportunities to do so, early voting, et cetera. She points out in Footnote 6 on page 23 that if a state sends unsolicited ballot applications to residents of white neighborhoods but not to residents of black neighborhoods, that would amount to giving the latter less opportunity to participate. And she's, you know, quoting the Republican party there. Wouldn't that be true even if black voters could vote in other ways?

The statute does speak on account of race, which means if it's justified, it's not on account of race, all right? So we simply take those standards, producing a uniformity in the law. That's my general question. My specific question is, what do you really say about the question that I think Justice Thomas was asking, that if you win in the details here, in many -- in the majority of states, they won't be able to engage in precinct voting, because a lot of the precincts will turn out to be maybe 10 feet or maybe 100 yards or maybe 1,000 yards on -- in general further away from a minority group of houses than a majority group of houses.

2499,44,4391.0,4499.0,Elena_Kagan,scotus_justice,"Ms. Amunson, the longer this argument goes on, the less clear I am as to how the parties' standards differ. So, if I understood what Mr. Carvin said at argument, as opposed to what he said in his brief, he said, of course, you should look at demographic realities. He even said, you know, it would be laughable not to look at demographic realities on occasion. And I bring you back to this hypothetical question where black voters have many fewer polling stations, even though that's a completely neutral rule on its face, but the way it operates is to make voting more difficult for black voters than white voters and leave it so that they -- the political system is not equally open to their participation. And he said, sure, you can -- you can look at that. And, similarly, you talked about, like, the practical evaluation of realities on the ground. So, I mean, tell me how you think these things differ.

2503,48,4802.0,4952.0,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Ms. Amunson. I want to explore how we got here as a statutory matter and try to square up the statutory text and common sense a bit. It seems like there are two polar positions one could have reading different parts of the statute. So Section 2(a) speaks only of results. That was the House bill, of course. And that strongly supports a position that any disproportionate impact would be problematic under the statute. Of course, the Dole compromise meant that Section 2(b) was added to the statute, and that speaks of opportunity. And a polar position on that would be, as was suggested in Mr. Carvin's brief, that time, place, and manner restrictions that are race-neutral provide equal opportunity. But, as Justice Kagan pointed out, just -- Mr. Carvin alluded to demographic realities being relevant, the state attorney general also talked about the totality of the circumstances being relevant, and, of course, in Section 2(b) -- refers to the totality of the circumstances. So, to the extent we're not at either polar position, we're between pure results and pure opportunity, as defined in -- in Mr. Carvin's brief at least, and we're in totality of the circumstances, two -- two circumstances that seem to make a difference as a matter of common sense. One, as the Chief Justice pointed out, when you have the Carter-Baker Commission saying that a particular state law is a good idea as a matter of policy, that would seem to be a circumstance that is -- as a matter of common sense, would -- would lend support to the state's rule. And then, secondly, and I mentioned this earlier, when a state rule is commonplace in other states, that would seem to be a circumstance that puts a thumb on the scale in favor of the legitimacy of the state rule and it not being a reflection of discriminatory intent. And, here, the out-of-precinct policy is in something like 26 other states, including a wide variety of states, including states with no history of discrimination. So, if we get into totality of the circumstances, why don't those two things matter? And you can comment more generally on how I've outlined this.",19-1257.wav,377,150.0,76832000,79232000,374,2.493333333333333,0.0016453110253418,7.341590065828183,0.2228522661095197,6.999693046857993,7.239693046857993,7.323026380191326,7.431359713524659,7.813026380191326,565.0,3.7666666666666666,-1.826317737319968,0.2637730496453901,0.0662000052311253,-32.4810950885934,0.1087305918335914,41.785141843439725,27.194327673971948,150.39492753623188,105.21289158651008,3.6720848504363617,0.9250921849183092,0.28827283278167437,0.0885866980349623,0.08267825216654537,0.05598365733477938,7.302647592312538,0.09655138904451238,7.131531228676175,0.1642337783726713,7.404602137767084,0.10076849787715361,7.537746077161023,0.145950966081457,8.134930016554963,0.4566865213451057,0.0025722081712864233,0.001067457467631925,7.447458978103783,0.11757742611642309,0.23515437131928815,0.093778177989873,106.37943262411348,70.00860142144354,2.6024435303402793,0.4200907396457913,-0.15217291260408963,0.6377656946574696

So, Ms. Amunson, I want to ask you a question about the degree of, say, inconvenience versus burden, because one of the difficulties in this case is that, you know, the attorney general says that the burden has to be substantial, Mr. Carvin's talking about the ordinary burdens of voting. And there's a difficulty that, you know, the statutory language and its lack of clarity presents in trying to figure out when something crosses from an inconvenience to a burden. You know, on the other side -- and I think some of the hypotheticals that Justice Alito was asking you emphasized this -- I think, you know, your position and its emphasis on any disparity at all risks saying that any election rule, you know, which, as Judge Easterbrook pointed out in his Frank opinion, you know, all election rules are going to make it easier for some to vote than others. So your approach risks ruling them all out. So let me give you an example. What about a rule that the polls close at 7 p.m. and because of socioeconomic reasons, it's harder for minority voters to get to the poll spot before 7 p.m. because of the time, you know, of their work hours in the day? Is that the kind of burden that triggers Section 2?

2513,58,6346.0,6406.0,Brett_M_Kavanaugh,scotus_justice,"Good morning, counsel. Section 2's language is elusive in the wake of the Dole compromise, which created murkiness because it was a compromise that generated then overwhelming support in Congress and from President Reagan, but the statute after the Dole compromise, I think you agree, creates something of a gray area between a pure results and pure opportunity. And you look at the totality of the circumstances, several counsel have said, including, I think you said, the Senate factors. One of those factors is, is there a good justification for these rules?

One is: What ground would we choose among several that you advance to say that you don't have to raise it? If the ground is the structure of the Social Security Administration, I do share the Chief Justice's suggestion that not necessarily new evidence but lawyers are very imaginative. They're very good. You sit in your office and you think up excellent arguments that people actually have never raised before and you bring them all to the district judges. Now why isn't that a problem?
