I have kind of a bigger picture thought to express, and you can react as -- as you wish. It seems like this case requires us to think about the balance between two very important rights recognized by this Court, the religious exercise and belief right, obviously, in the First Amendment, and the same-sex marriage right, as recognized in Obergefell. And it seems when those rights come into conflict, all levels of government should be careful and should often, where possible and appropriate, look for ways to accommodate both interests in reasonable ways. It's a very -- you know it's very sensitive, controversial. There are strong -- very strong feelings on all sides that warrant respect. And it seems like we and governments should be looking, where possible, for win-win answers, recognizing that neither side is going to win completely on these issues given the First Amendment on the one hand and given Obergefell on the other. But, when I look at this case, that's not at all what happened here. It seems like Philadelphia created a clash, it seems, and was looking for a fight and has brought that serious, controversial fight all the way to the Supreme Court even though no same-sex couple had gone to CSS, even though 30 agencies are available for same-sex couples, and even though CSS would refer any same-sex couple to one of those other agencies. And to be clear, I fully appreciate the stigmatic harm. I completely understand that, fully appreciate it. But we need to find a balance that also respects religious beliefs. That was the promise explicitly written by the Court in Obergefell and in Masterpiece, explicitly promised that respect for religious beliefs.

And good morning, Ms. Amunson. I want to explore how we got here as a statutory matter and try to square up the statutory text and common sense a bit. It seems like there are two polar positions one could have reading different parts of the statute. So Section 2(a) speaks only of results. That was the House bill, of course. And that strongly supports a position that any disproportionate impact would be problematic under the statute. Of course, the Dole compromise meant that Section 2(b) was added to the statute, and that speaks of opportunity. And a polar position on that would be, as was suggested in Mr. Carvin's brief, that time, place, and manner restrictions that are race-neutral provide equal opportunity. But, as Justice Kagan pointed out, just -- Mr. Carvin alluded to demographic realities being relevant, the state attorney general also talked about the totality of the circumstances being relevant, and, of course, in Section 2(b) -- refers to the totality of the circumstances. So, to the extent we're not at either polar position, we're between pure results and pure opportunity, as defined in -- in Mr. Carvin's brief at least, and we're in totality of the circumstances, two -- two circumstances that seem to make a difference as a matter of common sense. One, as the Chief Justice pointed out, when you have the Carter-Baker Commission saying that a particular state law is a good idea as a matter of policy, that would seem to be a circumstance that is -- as a matter of common sense, would -- would lend support to the state's rule. And then, secondly, and I mentioned this earlier, when a state rule is commonplace in other states, that would seem to be a circumstance that puts a thumb on the scale in favor of the legitimacy of the state rule and it not being a reflection of discriminatory intent. And, here, the out-of-precinct policy is in something like 26 other states, including a wide variety of states, including states with no history of discrimination. So, if we get into totality of the circumstances, why don't those two things matter? And you can comment more generally on how I've outlined this.",374,2.493333333333333,0.1087305918

And there's a difficulty that, you know, the statutory language and its lack of clarity presents in trying to figure out when something crosses from an inconvenience to a burden. You know, on the other side -- and I think some of the hypotheticals that Justice Alito was asking you emphasized this -- I think, you know, your position and its emphasis on any disparity at all risks saying that any election rule, you know, which, as Judge Easterbrook pointed out in his Frank opinion, you know, all election rules are going to make it easier for some to vote than others. So your approach risks ruling them all out. So let me give you an example. What about a rule that the polls close at 7 p.m. and because of socioeconomic reasons, it's harder for minority voters to get to the poll spot before 7 p.m. because of the time, you know, of their work hours in the day?

So I take that point, and that's an important one for me. But, at the same time, a couple other thoughts that I'll throw out there, and then you can react to them.

And I don't think you're going to disagree with that description necessarily, and so that leads me to think that one of the things we should be trying to do here is -- is to do no harm because there's lots of ripple effects from a broad decision. And with that in mind, there are statements in our decisions in Duro and Strate that really cut directly against you, as you're -- you're well aware. And you can say those are dicta, and that might be correct, but those have guided the law -- law enforcement for several decades. I think Congress and the executive could reasonably rely on those statements in the Court's decision. Certainly, the Cohen treatise treats those statements as authoritative in terms of guidance. So why isn't the best thing we can do here just to stick with what we said in those cases? It's not very analytically satisfying, but it's a narrow result.

And in that respect, Strate's footnote is perfectly consistent with that because, as the United States pointed out in argument and in its brief, you know, Cooley and -- and other non-members of the tribe are represented in the creation of federal law. And so it doesn't pose that same problem here. It's -- it's far less of an unfairness, and Strate's footnote can be seen to be consistent with that principle, particularly if the United States is right that one way to understand Montana is that that is an instance of implied preemption that cashes out when you consider the assertion of authority to adjudicate finally civil or criminal liability or the imposition of regulations on those who didn't participate in its exercise.

I'm not sure this wolf comes as a wolf, Mr. Stewart, but I still think it may be a wolf, as Justice Scalia famously said, and he said, in those cases, it can be discerned by careful and perceptive analysis. So here's why -- here -- here's the sources of my concern on that front. First, this structure is a real break from tradition, which we've said in cases like Free Enterprise Fund and many others, perhaps the most telling indication of a constitutional problem is the departure -- the lack of historical precedent. The lack of agency review of the ALJ decision by someone who's appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate is absent here and is ordinarily present and historically has been present. And then, second, the lack of accountability, as the Chief Justice said and Justice Gorsuch was just saying, these are multimillion, sometimes billion-dollar decisions being made not by someone who's accountable in the usual way that the Appointments Clause demands. And the director, on rehearing, does not have the unilateral power to reverse. So, you know, if Congress is going to do that, they can eliminate agency review and prevent removal at will, then it's easy to make these AL -- APJs presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed. They haven't done that. Where -- where in that analysis have things -- has that analysis gone wrong?",242,2.5987972508591066,0.9430720210000001

You can go with the executive model of ALJs, which is the traditional have ALJs and have agency review or removability, it's usually agency review, not removability with ALJs; or you can make the APJs principal officers with presidential appointment and Senate advice and consent if you want a more judicial model. But, here, the -- this hybrid gives enormous power to inferior officers, and it's really just out of the norm. Your response?",276,2.8267103646046703,0.390383482

It's the way that they work together. You know, so we could, if we decided that it was unconstitutional, perhaps make all of the APJs subject to -- say they're principal officers, and so they have to be subject to presidential appointment, senatorial confirmation. We could say, listen, we're going to strike the provision in the statute that says only the PTAB may grant rehearings so that the director has that authority.

And the founding generation conceived of principal officers as synonymous with heads of departments. In early debates and enactments that structured executive department, heads of the department were -- were referred to as principal officers and other members as inferior officers. There's a whole history that many of those inferior officers took final decisions in a wide variety of areas. Yet that's the way we proceeded. The history also shows that early statutes gave non-principal officers the power to make final adjudicatory decisions on behalf of the executive. Your opposing counsel pointed out that as early as 1793, non-principal officers were given the power to adjudicate patent disputes, and in 1803, land commissioners were given the power to make final determinations as to a claimant's right to a tract of land. I personally read this history as suggesting that principal officers were intended to be policymakers, and individuals who merely adjudicated claims based on said policies were not principal officers. So, for me, the person that has to be held responsible is not the individual ILJ -- or ALJ who is making a decision. It's the person who creates the policy. And for me, it's clear that APJs are not policymakers. All the policies are vested in the director. Precedential power is put in the director. The ALJs cannot influence the course of the law. That's only the director.

I want to pick up on something Justice Breyer brought up about the history of this issue and case law, because my understanding's very different from his, and I just wanted to get that out there, and you can respond. So here's my understanding of what's happened on this issue over the years: In 1966, Judge Friendly issued an opinion for the Second Circuit that said there was judicial review of these kinds of reopenings, and that's been the law in the Second Circuit for 54 years now. It's in a ""but see"" in the government's brief, but that's been the law in -- in the Second Circuit. Then along comes Califano in 1977, dealing, of course, with a different act with different language, and says no judicial review there. And then the courts of appeals essentially pick up on Califano in this context without paying attention, in my view, to the -- to the language difference in Califano, and you see the Seventh Circuit and the Fifth, Fourth, and Third all kind of go on the call -- Califano road, also a little bit with the greater includes the lesser point. And Califano doesn't work, as I think the government itself was going to have to acknowledge here, and so they're back-filling with textual arguments on 355(f), which you've answered, and then 231g. And I just would point out -- I think this is right, but you tell me if I'm wrong -- the government has never argued in this way the 231g point in all these cases. You know, you go back and look at the briefs and it's just not been part of that, presumably, because they've long understood, the Railroad Board at least, has long understood that denials of reopening, just like grants of reopening, obviously change your benefits if it's a grant of reopening, and so a denial too determines your rights and liabilities. So I think that I guess my understanding of the history of this is quite a bit different in terms of the case law in going back to Judge Friendly's opinion and what Justice Breyer said. And you can -- I mean, that's a favorable question to you, obviously. But, if you want to fill in any gaps there, go ahead.",384,2.978244852057238,0.2517057061

A -- a lot of your remedial argument seems to hinge on the happenstance that we had an acting director at the time of the Third Amendment's adoption. I -- I'd like to highlight two potential difficulties with that and ask for your thoughts. The first is the assumption that the acting director is answerable to the President while the director is not. Under the statute creating this outfit, the director appoints deputy directors, the director, not the President. It appears that those deputy directors would be insulated from the President therefore. And when -- when the director steps aside, he names the acting director, or, rather, he gives a pool of three of his deputies and the President chooses which of those three. But the director appointed all three of them. So I'm not sure in what sense or where we get the inference or how we generate from some penumbra emanating somewhere that the President has the removal power over this acting director. That's one. And two is, let's -- let's box in that, let's assume that's the case. So what? The -- the plaintiffs here challenged actions after -- during this whole period, including after a period in which the acting director disappeared and we now have a director. You say, well, that -- that -- that doesn't matter because the amendment is a thing that was adopted by the acting director. But the plaintiffs are challenging the director's actions as void because he is unanswerable to the President. So why wouldn't we at least be able to provide relief voiding the director's actions once we had a -- a -- a Senate-confirmed director in 2014?",283,2.37655357742694,0.1433747411

Was he convicted of a boat burglary or a house? And here's what it says to do: You look at the statute. Well, that doesn't help. They're all three. Then you look at the indictment or information. And then you look at the jury instructions. Now, if those three things, the statute, the jury instructions, and the -- and the indictment or information, show that this was burglary of a house, that it necessarily, we've said in about 10 cases, is burglary of a house, the government wins. And if they don't, the other side wins. Well, with slightly different words here, slightly different documents do the same thing. Does the statute forbid that? Of course not. The statute that you're talking about has words in it, and those words say that if the evidence indicates one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of relief apply, then the government wins.

You sort of looked at what Congress had in mind and -- and figured out the meaning in light of that.

But shouldn't we construe this statute in the environment in which Congress passed it in light of the, as I said, more free-wheeling approach?

I think Justice Brandeis, when he started, was faced with a business community that was very suspicious of the FTC's power and thought it would be abused and a progressive community that thought it's absolutely necessary to bring bad business practices under control. So they compromised. The compromise was you've got to do what the FTC says, but before it tells you to do something, it will find that what you're doing now is wrong. It will find that. It will be a cease-and-desist order, later expanded under Moss-Magnuson, I think, to include violation of a rule. So Section 5, cease-and-desist order or violation of a rule, ha, damage of some kind. Nineteen, the same thing. And now we have right in the middle 13, no protection like that whatsoever. Do not worry, says the FTC, we will only use it in exceptional cases. Ha! In 2012, they repeal that. And now, 10 years later, after this has been in effect for a few years, I read that 100 cases under this provision are in the courts, compared with 10 or 12 under the regular cases. And you say it's just obvious, we're going to get those people who think their bad conduct is obvious. Look at Skechers. Look at the Cardinal case. Go back to the famous Unburn case. Add substantiation. People wouldn't know that it is an unfair practice that a chiropractor who was married to a wife who had some income from the company and therefore is a conclusion as to the muscle toning of the company should be discounted. And that's the kind of case they're bringing now. Now do you see my point? On the one hand, it's well-established law in the lower court. On the other hand, if we interpret it your way, we -- we -- we say your fears, business community, were absolutely right. It is now up to the FTC. Before you know the thing is wrong, they hit you with bad damages. This case? Perhaps you're right. But Skechers, Cardinal, even Unburn, build strong bodies eight ways, that was Wonder Bread. They only did it six ways. I mean, you see, it's giving the FTC -- that -- that -- you get my point. Now I'd like to hear an answer.",383,2.4309742938749603,1.143750906

Prong 3, I think, clearly is related to the proceeding at issue: Would he have been found guilty? But prong 4 is talking more broadly about the public's perception of the judicial system as qua system. And so I don't know that the answer to your question is the same with respect to prong 3 and prong 4. I understand your argument that whether this proceeding would have been different, yes, under prong 3, and so that you may have shown prejudice, but, with respect to prong 4, I think that what the public would be looking at, qua the judge as well, is the entire proceeding. And, there, I don't see why a judge can't look at the facts of -- of a particular case from beginning to end to determine whether the public would have seen this as an injustice. And given all of the circumstances or potential circumstances, some of which are just like this case, that Justice Alito mentioned, your defendant was just released from prison six months before he was arrested for this charge, and he had served either 20 months or 36 months, it's impossible to believe that there's any reasonable doubt that he could have put his knowledge in contention.

So, on the tax, I see this as a Subchapter 68 penalty that, therefore, qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. On Direct Marketing, it seems to me that that's arguably distinct because the penalty there was not a tax. Here, it is so defined as a tax and, therefore, comes within the scope of the Anti-Injunction Act. Then we get to the question -- and there's -- and there's other questions -- but the regulatory tax question, the Bob Jones and Alexander cases, and I want to get your reaction to this, which is I think reading those cases as they are poses a problem for you, but I'm not sure those cases are -- should be read for all they're worth. In other words, I'm wondering whether those cases -- we should back away from some of the implications of those cases for challenges to regulatory taxes for the reasons, some of the reasons you've given here, that it seems somewhat unfair, as it did even in those cases, somewhat unfair to force someone to go through the process that you're talking about here.

And good afternoon, Mr. Bond. I'm going to tell you where I'm -- I think I'm with you and where I think I have a problem. On the text of the Anti-Injunction Act, I think you have a strong argument, Subchapter 68 and how that fits here. This penalty is designated a tax; therefore, it fits within the AIA. Direct Marketing, I think you have a good point. That was not subject -- that penalty was not denominated a tax and, therefore, the reason the two cases would be different is that the text of the statutes is different. You make a good point there, I think. In terms of the Regan point, how you would do this, you say you file a letter objecting to it, and you then have post- -- you have proceedings after the IRS assesses the penalty. That all makes sense to me as well. The criminal point, Justice Alito's point, you just said the Court could flat-out say that it's not a willful violation when you're challenging the reporting requirement being unlawful. So that -- we could -- we could say that. Here's where I think I have a concern: On Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander, those cases, you were having a discussion with Justice Kagan, either/or, are you challenging the regulatory aspect of this or the reporting aspect of this, or are you challenging the tax aspect? I think you're challenging both as a plaintiff really. And what Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander seem to say -- and this supports you -- is that when you're doing that, you have to go -- the AIA applies. And I -- I agree with you that those cases support you. But I also think Justice Gorsuch makes a very good point that the current philosophy that's -- those cases are from a different era. The current philosophy of challenging administrative action is different, as the Chief Justice said, with presumptions. And, here, where I really think Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander may be different is when the penalties are so high if you lose. In other words, you have to bet, and if you bet and lose, penalties are so high that it's going to deter you from challenging the regulatory or reporting aspect in the first place. So the bottom -- long-wind up, bottom-line question. Shouldn't -- as a matter of fairness, modern era of administrative law, presumptions, shouldn't we carve out an exception from Bob Jones, Alexander, Bailey, when the penalties for trying to challenge something are so high that it's going to be coercive and effectively deter you from bringing this kind of challenge in the first place?",451,2.774957698815567,0.4967644215

What AT&T says is, but that is a question of arbitrability. It is a question whether this dispute is arbitrable. So it's for the judge. But where there is an arbitration clause in the contract, as there was in First Options as far as the owners knew, but where there is a -- where there is an arbitration clause, then there is a presumption of arbitrability. All right? So that seems to me, Judge, you decide. You decide whether this particular dispute is sent to an arbitrator or -- or for the court, i.e., is it arbitrable, you decide, Judge, but if there's an arbitration clause in the contract, you decide with the presumption of arbitrability that it will normally be arbitrable. That's what it seems to say. And so the judge was right to decide it below, but he didn't decide it right because he should have given it a presumption of arbitrability. Now that's how I read those two cases, but also in the back of my mind is what in heaven's name happens in labor arbitration.

When you look at the AAA rules, Rule 7(a) says, ""the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.""

So courts will decide whether certain things are arbitrable or not, and arbitrators will decide whether other things are arbitrable. I think that's what you're saying.

I think that these cases that you have fall into three groups. The one are they are declaratory judgment actions in a world before declaratory judgment actions. In other words, they're ways to try to determine legal rights going forward before the declaratory judgment form existed. The second group of cases are cases in which there's injury that's hard to monetize, and -- and these cases are asking for something to recompense that injury. But the reason why those cases aren't very relevant anymore is that, in our world, we monetize those claims all the time. We now live in a world, unlike the historical world, in which we acknowledge claims for emotional distress, claims for dignitary harms of all kinds, which makes the nominal damages claim unnecessary. The third group of cases is a case in which what the plaintiff really wants is vindication. It's a statement that I'm right, the defendant is wrong. And as to those cases, modern Article III jurisprudence says that, you know, you don't -- that's not a case or controversy.

I think what everyone has forgotten here is that, at least in this situation, there was no immediate danger to the person threatening suicide and no immediate danger to the wife because the suicide person was removed to a hospital. And so the issue is, can the police, notwithstanding that and notwithstanding the ability to ask the wife whether she would consent to giving up the gun and ammunition, that they decided on their own to go in and seize the gun.

There's a heightened risk that this person is going to sneak away before the house can be surrounded. One of the briefs says it takes six to eight officers to surround the house waiting for a warrant.

You can have all sorts of environmental crimes, other things that don't cause -- that don't create exigency in the same sense that Santana was announcing the rule or that the common law came from. And so I don't know why anybody is arguing that there's a difference between felony and misdemeanors and why we're recognizing a categorical rule at all. Why isn't the better reading just that hot pursuit is a type of exigent circumstance that can but does not always justify warrantless entry, regardless of whether the underlying offense is a felony or misdemeanor? If you look at our holding in Santana, we talked about all of the circumstances that would make it likely that a drug dealer would destroy evidence once they saw the police officer on -- on the scene. Our next case, Stanton, was not about whether or not the issue was a felony or not. It was -- the issue was, was the situation such as to justify, reasonably, entry?

But I wonder if the exigent circumstances doctrine, in other words, the first option, really wouldn't provide, you know, not as clear a rule but still a pretty clear rule for officers because the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine really, as I see it, tracks common sense, these are the kinds of cases and the kinds of reasons an officer would do this in the first place, want to go into the house without a warrant, especially escape of the suspect, threats to others, destruction of evidence.

And just by way of comparison about -- and to show how much it means to people, you know, arguably, the greatest basketball player of all time is inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009 and gives a speech, and what does he talk about? He talks about getting cut as a sophomore from the varsity team. And he wasn't joking. He was critical 30 years later. It still -- it still bothered him. And I think that's just emblematic of how much it means to kids to make a high school team. It is so important to their lives, and coaches sweat the cuts, and it guts coaches to have to cut a kid who's on the bubble, and -- and good coaches understand the importance and they understand the emotions. So maybe what bothers me when I read all this is that it didn't seem like the punishment was tailored to the offense given what I just said about how important it is and you know how much it means to the kids.

The difficulty I have I've already mentioned. A few years ago, a superintendent of schools, I think in San Francisco, said, you know, schools have changed a lot, public schools, since when I went there. He said, today we don't just teach classical subjects. We're there to help the child have adequate health, in many cases, to see that he's adequately fed. In quite a few cases, we become a caretaker, and we don't want to send them home immediately because there's nobody home, and we have to plan after-school activities. There are dozens of areas that didn't used to be thought of as within the purview of the public school. Today, in many places, they are. Now add to that the Internet and the Internet not just listening to teachers but also doing homework and also writing papers, sometimes vaguely defined and sometimes and sometimes. How do I get a standard out of that? I'm frightened to death of writing a standard. And Tinker, after all, doesn't really write a standard. It just says you can't regulate school unless it substantially disrupts or hurts somebody else. It doesn't say if it does that you can do anything you want. You still must use some kind of test, like proportionality or something else, and I can mention that often outside of school it's the parents' job, not the teachers' if, by the way, there are parents in the house, et cetera, and I can mention the differences and say take those into account.

Rebuttal, Ms. Blatt. MS. BLATT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. There's some sort of twilight zone going on when the head of the ACLU says that schools allow hecklers' veto, punishment for whistleblowing, any kind of reporting, any kind of criticism, all that matters is someone is offended. And you have the Biden administration and the school district saying that's not true. That's not what Tinker allows. Now Mr. Cole said the case law allows us to act like Soviets and the North -- North Koreans. But the -- since the Saxe opinion, the Morse concurrence, Fillmore and Zalon Acts have left clean -- clear lines for schools in that hecklers' vetoes are not allowed. And your choice is this: If you -- you could choose to either tighten Tinker or you can say, well, we're going to assume Tinker is out of control on campus, but we will leave open season on schools and complete chaos as to what their test allows. Under their view, all 50 states define bullying in terms of Tinker. You have the same e-mail chain that would toggle on and off campus and you would have the Tinker test applying when there's some on-campus speech, and I don't know what applies. I think Mr. Cole said it's the Tinker test, but he's afraid to use the Tinker word because it's scary, and it shouldn't be. You're much better off cleaning this doctrine up. Justice Kagan, you had amazing questions about school speech. Remember, our test is the audience has to be the school, so all of your speech, if it's to the press, the police, your pastor, your family, et cetera, none of that is school speech even if it involves a school topic. Justice Barrett, on threats, the facts in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Bell, nobody knew whether that was a threat. The police were sort of involved. It is not fair to the parents of those other kids to have schools fumbling around. Well, I don't know what this applies before we had Tinker, part of the threats were on campus, part were off, it was on the Internet. Let's look at where she drafted it, maybe she was to and from. Now let's move to the school supervision: madness, confusion, and chaos. Please don't do this to schools. Mr. Cole said you could prevent swearing to and from school. That's nuts. You're in the dad's minivan. That's school supervision under their view. No one thinks Fraser applied there, and yet all of a sudden, when you get out of the minivan and I guess walking to it, it maybe depends on how fair you park, Tinker is going in and out of coverage, that rule makes no sense. There's no case law on conduct that aids and abets school speech. You will have a school speech petition. You can keep denying cert, but I guarantee the courts are going to -- they're going to freak out when Tinker has been the law off campus for 20 years. Thank you.",510,3.072289156626506,1.2218077183

But, if you look at the smaller number of -- of those who are held in detention facilities, it's -- it's something like 60,000. The first number could easily change the apportionment of representatives. The second one, it's much more doubtful that it would change the apportionment of representatives.

Lear said that Scott had undermined the basis for patent estoppel even more than Westinghouse had. So it read Westinghouse as undermining the basis for patent estoppel. The world has changed greatly since then, as Justice Breyer pointed out, in terms of employee/employer relations and how these contracts of adhesions are often used against employees.

I think Congress uses ""extension"" sometimes even when something's lapsed. We have the examples -- COVID and other examples. You make a big deal about ordinary usage, but I'll give you three instances in my life where ordinary usage goes the other way from what you -- what you say. So sometimes one that you're teaching and you have a 5:00 p.m. due date for a paper, you know, after the due date, you will get an e-mail entitled Extension Request, you grant a paper extension afterwards. Or when a -- you use a sports contract example in your brief, but oftentimes, if the contract ends at the end of the season, in the off-season, the player signs a new contract. That will be described by most people as player extends for two more years. Or, if you let your print newspaper subscription lapse for a time and then you start it up again, you'll tell your family member or friend, oh, I extended the paper subscription. So I -- I think ordinary usage also, like congressional usage, in my experience at least doesn't tell us exactly. So how do we break this?

And then also on the purpose and context, if we get to that, to help break what -- I don't want to say tie, but to figure out what Congress was thinking about with the word or what it was doing with the word ""extension,"" your position is that Congress wanted small fine -- refineries to have no outlet at all, to essentially go out of business, whereas the other side's position is simply that EPA would have authority, as a matter of separation of powers, authority to grant an exemption if a small refinery had -- had a -- had a problem, and it really seems quite implausible to think Congress wanted refineries in that circumstance to go out of business.

And good morning, Mr. Waxman. I want to pick up from Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch and identify some issues of concern to me as I look at this. I start from the idea that the antitrust laws should not be a cover for exploitation of the student-athletes, so that is a concern, a overarching concern here. I see your rhetoric and tradition and history argument being very similar to the arguments that were made for exempting baseball from the antitrust laws, Flood v. Kuhn, Federal -- Federal Baseball, and that -- that exemption has not been replicated in other sports in other cases. And then, in Regents, as Justice Kagan said, that really was from a different era, it -- it was dicta, not sure it was fully considered dicta, and, in any event, from a different era. So then we get to regular antitrust law, rule of reason, and I just want to drill down on your asserted procompetitive justification and how you say the product is differentiated. It does seem, as Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch suggested, Justice Alito, that schools are conspiring with competitors, agreeing with competitors, I'll say that, to pay no salaries to the workers who are making the schools billions of dollars on the theory that consumers want the schools to pay their workers nothing. And that just seems entirely circular and even somewhat disturbing. And then, as Justice Kagan says, it's not even factually supported in the record in this case. It seems to blend back to the tradition argument, and all things circle back to this idea, well, it should just -- just don't worry about it, college athletics is different, just like baseball.

And anybody who had been sentenced under the old range, go back and get resentenced. Fine. The problem is, what has this section got to do with it, (C)? Because this section seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with that ratio. It punishes people for 20 years or for 30 years if they commit a felony, for example, of any drug, Schedule I, Schedule II, plus two others, any drug, any of those drugs with intent to distribute it. It had nothing to do with the ratio. And if you look at the guideline, which is Level 34 for a career criminal, section -- category 6, that has nothing to do with it. That only -- not only picks up all the people who twice committed that felony, the crack one, and also people who twice committed many forms of robbery and twice committed. So, if you win this case, I don't see what's to prevent any person -- any person certainly who convicted of any drug felony, career criminal, from going out and asking, Judge, resentence me.

And good morning, Mr. Mortara. Picking up on Justice Kagan's questions, if the statutory text is ambiguous, given the cross-reference, it seems to me that the other side is asking us to look at a few things or maybe there are a few things that could be considered in how to think about this statute, and I just want to get your reaction to these things. And so one is the, you know, relatively small amount. Justice Sotomayor alluded to this. I asked about the cost. Fifty dollars. And assume it's a few hundred dollars, it's still a low amount that we're talking about here, not the kind of situation that I think most -- most people have in mind when they think about lengthy sentences for -- for federal sentencing. So that's one. Two is the history of the disparity, the crack powder disparity. This all kind of stems to June 19, 1986, when Len Bias died, and that was a shocking event, particularly in this area, particularly for those of us who -- you know, I was a year younger than he was, looked up to him, like everyone in this area did, and that was a shocking event in this area and -- and ultimately in the country at large and prompted Congress, along with other things, but that was really the proximate cause of Congress moving to establish the 100-to-1 ratio, even though that was a powder situation in the Len Bias situation, the 100-to-1 disparity is ushered into the law, and then there are racial disparities, of course, that develop over time, and Congress really has been working now for 35 years hearing about this and working to claw that back. So that -- that's something we should be thinking about, I think the other side would say. And then the third, which we've touched on, is the reality of sentencing judges and how they really, in practice -- I take Justice Breyer's point that some of them in some cases are going to think differently about this when they're close to the limit of five versus not close to the 28. So those three things together, to -- to the extent the statute's ambiguous, low amount, the history, the racial disparities, and the reality of sentencing, and you can take whatever time you want to answer those.",397,2.652590786088932,0.472710371

One, you rule out the death penalty or life without parole for a certain class of offenses or offenders.

It would be hard for courts to do that, wouldn't necessarily be equitable, given the number of courts who would be involved hearing similarly situated plaintiffs. Rather, I viewed the doctrine at least as it's been articulated as reflecting a general foreign policy concern, and then the question becomes the particulars of the doctrine. And I had understood the argument to be that, if foreign defendants harm foreign parties in a foreign country and remedies are available in the foreign country, then American courts should usually abstain.

It's like, as Judge Boudin said, the QWERTY keyboard. You didn't have to have a QWERTY keyboard on typewriters at the beginning, but, my God, if you let somebody have a copyright on that now, they would control all typewriters, which really has nothing to do with copyright. Or it's like switchboards on old-fashioned telephone systems. You could have done it in 1,000 ways. But, once you did it, all those operators across the world learned that system, and you don't want to give a copyright holder a monopoly of -- hmm -- telephone systems. Or it's like, to use the Chief Justice's example, a chef who figures out brilliant ways of mixing spices and then putting the spices for this and that in a certain order on a shelf, and then he writes something that tells you which shelf to go to and which shelf to pick out -- and which spice to pick out for which dish. Now all those things are somewhat ordinary programs, but they also are doing something. They're giving you an instruction as to how to call up those programs that reflect Java's organization. And at this point in time, it's really tough, just like the QWERTY keyboard, to go backwards, and very bad consequences will flow if you don't see that distinction. Okay? Long question, but that's what I got out of their method of operation argument. And I wanted you to say what you want about that.",384,2.543046357615894,0.7614259124

The problem with that argument for me is that it seems that since 1992, and Justice Kagan mentioned the case, the Second Circuit case, a Ninth Circuit case, an Eleventh Circuit case, a First Circuit case, that a basic principle has developed in the case law, up until the Federal Circuit's decision. I know there was a Third Circuit decision earlier on in the 1980s. But the other circuits moved away from that. They and the entire computer world have not tried to analogize computer codes to other methods of expression because it's sui generis. They've looked at its functions, and they've said the API, the Application Programming Interface, of which the declaring code is a part, is not copyrightable. Implementing codes are. And on that understanding, industries have built up around applications that know they can -- they can copy only what's necessary to run on the application, but they have to change everything else. That's what Google did here. That's why it took less than 1 percent of the Java code. So I guess that's the way the world has run in every other system. Whether it's Apple's desktop or Amazon's web services, everybody knows that APIs are not -- declaring codes are not copyrightable. Implementing codes are. So please explain to me why we should now upend what the industry has viewed as the copyrightable elements and has declared that some are methods of operation and some are expressions.

Thank you. Go back for a minute to the late 1940s, early 1950s. Most of the natural gas was in the Permian Basin in Oklahoma and in Texas, and they were on the verge of or had built pipelines to carry that natural gas to California, San Diego, El Paso Natural Gas, or up to Pennsylvania, over to Illinois, up to Massachusetts. A lot of the states -- not a lot, but some were objecting in a whole variety of complex ways. And so Congress passed the Natural Gas Act. Now they couldn't have built the pipelines unless they had this power, I think, I'm not certain of that, but I don't see how they could have because they need -- go look at the map on the -- the map of waterways in which Pennsylvania claims an interest in the Marcellus Shale Coalition. They zone water beds. They own all kinds of obstacles. But this was passed to build a pipeline. How could they have done it? I don't see it. And having known a little bit about that, since you need the federal power or a government power to -- for a private person to use eminent domain for anything against a private land or by a state, I don't understand how they would have -- how any reasonable person would have delegated any eminent-domain power to the Natural Gas Act, which was for interstate pipelines, without including the power to proceed against the state. Am I right about that? And, if I am right and, therefore, it is clearly in this statute, why in heaven's name can't the Federal Power Commission then, or FERC now, have done the same thing? And if they could have done the same thing under law of Congress, why can't they hire somebody, just as Mississippi hires private prosecutors sometimes in criminal cases? Or there are dozens of examples where private persons are delegated under supervision, and, here, the supervision is close, to go and do something that the public can do by bringing a criminal case, et cetera, et cetera.

I -- I have to say join me up with Justices Alito and Kagan. I'm baffled by the distinction that you're drawing between ""credibility"" and ""persuasiveness."" And it's not actually consistent with the way that I've seen cases come up for review in the court of appeals from IJs who make adverse credibility determinations. The ones I've seen, you know, they've essentially been equivalent to saying that the witness is lying. This -- this fine distinction between ""believable"" and ""believed"" just seems, you know, nitpicking to me. As Justice Kavanaugh was saying, it seems to me more like ""credibility"" refers to are they lying, and then ""persuasiveness,"" as Justice Kavanaugh was suggesting, points to other reasons why you might not believe them. So I could -- you know, thinking about your example with the child and the crumbs, I was thinking as you talked about an example about my child. I come home and find the child hysterically crying, and she said someone was beating at the door, I think somebody was trying to break into her house -- our house. And I can believe her. I don't think she's lying. But then my neighbor says, yeah, you know, I -- I saw it was the UPS man. So I would not find her story persuasive, not because of credibility but because there was other evidence that showed she was not, in fact, in danger. It was the UPS deliveryman. So I don't think that -- you -- you seem to be leaning heavily on the fact that the statute uses both the words ""credibility"" and ""persuasiveness,"" and I just don't see it. So I want to ask you what's wrong with seeing it this way: that the IJ makes a determination about credibility, and that has to be express, and when it gets up to the Board, there are two ways in which the Board might have to confront this presumption. Either the IJ actually found the alien incredible and the Board disagrees, in which case it has to confront the presumption and explain why it thinks the evidence rebuts that presumption of credibility, or the IJ might not have done a good enough job in making an adverse credibility determination explicit, as the statute requires, and then, still, the Board has to presume credibility and then explain why it thinks the presumption is rebutted. If the Board offers such an explanation, once it gets up to the court of appeals, the court of appeals isn't applying any kind of presumption. The court of appeals is just reviewing it for substantial evidence and seeing if the Board's explanation -- and the Board has to show that it understood what presumption should be there -- whether the Board's explanation was rational and substantial evidence supported its determination that the alien was not telling the truth.

The applicant didn't perjure himself. But then there are -- there is extraneous evidence that could come in to show that the applicant was wrong. And -- and -- and that distinction actually makes all the sense in the world in a statute like this, which is about a well-grounded fear of persecution, that the applicant can testify as to his fear and all the things underlying it. But then there can be other evidence which shows that that fear is not well grounded, notwithstanding the truthfulness of what the applicant said. So let's take that as the sort of premise of what the statute does. Dai, it seems to me, could have lost in two ways in -- in that world. One is if we understand the Board to have rejected the -- the -- the -- the presumption of credibility. In other words, they have decided that, in fact, Dai was lying when he said that this was the reason that he wanted asylum. And the second is, no, they accepted that he was telling the truth, but there is extraneous evidence indicating that he's wrong as to his fear of going back to China.
