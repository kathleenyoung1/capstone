In part for reasons others have expressed, that would not be predictable. It would be hard for courts to do that, it wouldn't necessarily be equitable, given the number of courts who would be involved hearing similarly situated plaintiffs. Rather, I viewed that the doctrine at least as it's been articulating as reflecting a general foreign policy concern, and then the question becomes the particulars of the doctrine. And I had understood the argument to be that, if foreign defendants harm foreign parties in a foreign country and remedies are available in the foreign country, then American courts should usually abstain.

By the plain text, it seems to me that any TPS holder who is granted permission to travel abroad and return would be admitted within the meaning of Section 1255. Yet you're telling me that the agency has said no in 2020. It makes no sense to me, counsel.

They did it according to the report of the Engineering Advisory Committee, and that's how they decided that evaporation question. That seems right. And then he pointed to VI(c), which says, unless there's a more feasible method, you ought to use the report of the Engineering Advisory Committee. And that's what the -- that's what he used. So I understood this very simply. The water's gone. It evaporated. They go to the Advisory Committee's report. They use that and say the evaporated water is Texas's.

So, here, Van Buren could get the license plates, and it didn't matter if he was getting them for a reason that he was not supposed to get them for. So it -- it seems to me that you are looking at authorization in a -- in a bright gates up or gates down kind of way, whereas the government is looking at scope of authorization as included.

You're asking us to write definitions to narrow what could otherwise be viewed as a very broad statute and dangerously vague.

Imagine a law that says anyone who drives on Elm Street who is not authorized so to drive shall be punished. The ""so to drive"" to me could mean if you're not authorized to drive on Elm Street. But, under your theory, it could be and might very possibly be read as saying you can't ride on Elm Street if you're driving on it with an illegal purpose, you're speeding, you're breaking the law on curfew, you're texting. It could even cover people who drive on Elm Street on their way to commit a different crime, because they weren't authorized to be on Elm Street for the purpose of committing a crime.

So, you know, (f)(1) says liability under 9607 or 9606. And then (f)(3)(B) does not say that but instead uses a very different formulation, drops the section numbers, and says liability for some or all of a response action.

It could mean that, but it could also mean CERCLA actions, okay? It could mean either. And if I look at the definition of ""response,"" it starts by saying ""for purposes of this subchapter."" Then I look at the definition of ""response"" and it's about 450 to 500 words, including all kinds of things -- I'm tempted to say anything under the sun, that isn't quite true -- but all kinds of technical things, perimeter protection using dikes, you know, collection of leachate. How do I know whether a state has a collection of leachate law that has nothing really to do with CERCLA? And I don't know. But there could be a lot of lawyers who don't know. And when they go into any one of what could be thousands of cases that involve some of these 450 or 500 words under some law of a state or other federal law, do they know they have only three years to ask for contribution? I mean, this is a pretty tough reading, and a lot of people just won't know they have only three years. They might think they had seven or something else. So what kind of a boundary is this if we read it your way? I mean, what statutes are involved?

It -- it seems to me, just for the reasons Justice Alito just said, the simplest reason, if ""response action"" is CERCLA-specific in terms of all of the activities that can be, why should we build that into a different act, like the Clean Water Act?

And that's where I think Elrod and Branti would have quite a -- a lot to say about whether or not your political affiliations have much to do with your decision-making. And -- and that, I think, would be what we would have to face given Justice Alito's question, a governor who says, I won't appoint somebody from another party under any circumstance. But that's not the case here. The case here involves the State, and it's the State's choice for its own interests balancing partisanship and promoting an independent judiciary who says, I want to prohibit both your client and the State and the governor from acting in a particular way, i.e. from selecting you merely because you're an Independent. And it seems to me that the bare majority rule, that, or prohibition in this case, is more than adequate to take care of those two interests, but the majority party rule doesn't -- isn't.

371,"All right. I -- we all have the same question, I guess. Mine is the same as Justice Thomas and the Chief Justice, but let me try to put it less accurately than they did in simpler -- and directly. Look, the -- the ratio between crack and ordinary cocaine was ridiculous, 100 to 1 or something. So Congress finally got around to modifying that. Fine. And anybody who had been sentenced under the old range, go back and get resentenced. Fine. The problem is, what has this section got to do with it, (C)? Because this section seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with that ratio. It punishes people for 20 years or for 30 years if they commit a felony, for example, of any drug, Schedule I, Schedule II, plus two others, any drug, any of those drugs with intent to distribute it. It had nothing to do with the ratio. And if you look at the guideline, which is Level 34 for a career criminal, section -- category 6, that has nothing to do with it. That only -- not only picks up all the people who twice committed that felony, the crack one, and also people who twice committed many forms of robbery and twice committed. So, if you win this case, I don't see what's to prevent any person -- any person certainly who convicted of any drug felony, career criminal, from going out and asking, Judge, resentence me. Now that's the practical problem I have, as well as the language not really applying. You get me out of this. I'd love to get out of it. I mean, I think they were much too high. I understand that.

The guidelines say a career offender -- that's what he was -- is sentenced at level 34, category 6. Okay? Now he was sentenced at level 34, category 6 with some modifications to get the sentence down. That's a very high level. Now let's imagine Mr. Terry being sentenced exactly the same way after the change. Why would there be a difference? The only difference could be in the propensity of the judge to depart from the guidelines, to depart downward. And I don't see why. This statute punishes people who are career offenders as applied to him, whether it's methamphetamine, whether it's cocaine, or whether it's crack. And why would the sentence be different, the one from the other, in respect to drugs, whether it's one drug or the other?

414,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Mortara. Picking up on Justice Kagan's questions, if the statutory text is ambiguous, given the cross-reference, it seems to me that the other side is asking us to look at a few things or maybe there are a few things that could be considered in how to think about this statute, and I just want to get your reaction to these things. And so one is the, you know, relatively small amount. Justice Sotomayor alluded to this. I asked about the cost. Fifty dollars. And assume it's a few hundred dollars, it's still a low amount that we're talking about here, not the kind of situation that I think most -- most people have in mind when they think about lengthy sentences for -- for federal sentencing. So that's one. Two is the history of the disparity, the crack powder disparity. This all kind of stems to June 19, 1986, when Len Bias died, and that was a shocking event, particularly in this area, particularly for those of us who -- you know, I was a year younger than he was, looked up to him, like everyone in this area did, and that was a shocking event in this area and -- and ultimately in the country at large and prompted Congress, along with other things, but that was really the proximate cause of Congress moving to establish the 100-to-1 ratio, even though that was a powder situation in the Len Bias situation, the 100-to-1 disparity is ushered into the law, and then there are racial disparities, of course, that develop over time, and Congress really has been working now for 35 years hearing about this and working to claw that back. So that -- that's something we should be thinking about, I think the other side would say. And then the third, which we've touched on, is the reality of sentencing judges and how they really, in practice -- I take Justice Breyer's point that some of them in some cases are going to think differently about this when they're close to the limit of five versus not close to the 28.

So, if, in fact, there's a finding he's credible, then you take that finding and you say is there, with that finding, substantial evidence.

The witness knows it was red but testifies it was green. So the witness is lying. That's the first inquiry, is the witness lying?

440,"Good morning, Ms. Sinzdak. I -- I have to say join me up with Justices Alito and Kagan. I'm baffled by the distinction that you're drawing between ""credibility"" and ""persuasiveness."" And it's not actually consistent with the way that I've seen cases come up for review in the court of appeals from IJs who make adverse credibility determinations. The ones I've seen, you know, they've essentially been equivalent to saying that the witness is lying. This -- this fine distinction between ""believable"" and ""believed"" just seems, you know, nitpicking to me. As Justice Kavanaugh was saying, it seems to me more like ""credibility"" refers to are they lying, and then ""persuasiveness,"" as Justice Kavanaugh was suggesting, points to other reasons why you might not believe them. So I could -- you know, thinking about your example with the child and the crumbs, I was thinking as you talked about an example about my child. I come home and find the child hysterically crying, and she said someone was beating at the door, I think somebody was trying to break into her house -- our house. And I can believe her. I don't think she's lying. But then my neighbor says, yeah, you know, I -- I saw it was the UPS man. So I would not find her story persuasive, not because of credibility but because there was other evidence that showed she was not, in fact, in danger. It was the UPS deliveryman. So I don't think that -- you -- you seem to be leaning heavily on the fact that the statute uses both the words ""credibility"" and ""persuasiveness,"" and I just don't see it. So I want to ask you what's wrong with seeing it this way: that the IJ makes a determination about credibility, and that has to be express, and when it gets up to the Board, there are two ways in which the Board might have to confront this presumption. Either the IJ actually found the alien incredible and the Board disagrees, in which case it has to confront the presumption and explain why it thinks the evidence rebuts that presumption of credibility, or the IJ might not have done a good enough job in making an adverse credibility determination explicit, as the statute requires, and then, still, the Board has to presume credibility and then explain why it thinks the presumption is rebutted. If the Board offers such an explanation, once it gets up to the court of appeals, the court of appeals isn't applying any kind of presumption. The court of appeals is just reviewing it for substantial evidence and seeing if the Board's explanation -- and the Board has to show that it understood what presumption should be there -- whether the Board's explanation was rational and substantial evidence supported its determination that the alien was not telling the truth.

The applicant didn't perjure himself. But then there are -- there is extraneous evidence that could come in to show that the applicant was wrong.

One is if we understand the Board to have rejected the -- the -- the -- the presumption of credibility.

541,"Good morning, Ms. Harris. I want to pick up on something Justice Breyer brought up about the history of this issue and case law, because my understanding's very different from his, and I just wanted to get that out there, and you can respond. So here's my understanding of what's happened on this issue over the years: In 1966, Judge Friendly issued an opinion for the Second Circuit that said there was judicial review of these kinds of reopenings, and that's been the law in the Second Circuit for 54 years now. It's in a ""but see"" in the government's brief, but that's been the law in -- in the Second Circuit. Then along comes Califano in 1977, dealing, of course, with a different act with different language, and says no judicial review there. And then the courts of appeals essentially pick up on Califano in this context without paying attention, in my view, to the -- to the language difference in Califano, and you see the Seventh Circuit and the Fifth, Fourth, and Third all kind of go on the call -- Califano road, also a little bit with the greater includes the lesser point. And Califano doesn't work, as I think the government itself was going to have to acknowledge here, and so they're back-filling with textual arguments on 355(f), which you've answered, and then 231g. And I just would point out -- I think this is right, but you tell me if I'm wrong -- the government has never argued in this way the 231g point in all these cases. You know, you go back and look at the briefs and it's just not been part of that, presumably, because they've long understood, the Railroad Board at least, has long understood that denials of reopening, just like grants of reopening, obviously change your benefits if it's a grant of reopening, and so a denial too determines your rights and liabilities. So I think that I guess my understanding of the history of this is quite a bit different in terms of the case law in going back to Judge Friendly's opinion and what Justice Breyer said. And you can -- I mean, that's a favorable question to you, obviously.

613,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Ms. Amunson. I want to explore how we got here as a statutory matter and try to square up the statutory text and common sense a bit. It seems like there are two polar positions one could have reading different parts of the statute. So Section 2(a) speaks only of results. That was the House bill, of course. And that strongly supports a position that any disproportionate impact would be problematic under the statute. Of course, the Dole compromise meant that Section 2(b) was added to the statute, and that speaks of opportunity. And a polar position on that would be, as was suggested in Mr. Carvin's brief, that time, place, and manner restrictions that are race-neutral provide equal opportunity. But, as Justice Kagan pointed out, just -- Mr. Carvin alluded to demographic realities being relevant, the state attorney general also talked about the totality of the circumstances being relevant, and, of course, in Section 2(b) -- refers to the totality of the circumstances. So, to the extent we're not at either polar position, we're between pure results and pure opportunity, as defined in -- in Mr. Carvin's brief at least, and we're in totality of the circumstances, two -- two circumstances that seem to make a difference as a matter of common sense. One, as the Chief Justice pointed out, when you have the Carter-Baker Commission saying that a particular state law is a good idea as a matter of policy, that would seem to be a circumstance that is -- as a matter of common sense, would -- would lend support to the state's rule. And then, secondly, and I mentioned this earlier, when a state rule is commonplace in other states, that would seem to be a circumstance that puts a thumb on the scale in favor of the legitimacy of the state rule and it not being a reflection of discriminatory intent. And, here, the out-of-precinct policy is in something like 26 other states, including a wide variety of states, including states with no history of discrimination. So, if we get into totality of the circumstances, why don't those two things matter? And you can comment more generally on how I've outlined this.",Brett_M_Kavanaugh,19-1257,48,4802.0,4952.0,4802,4952,5.078594379170673,0.15279794286115989,0.0006239435113921508,122.53909756299964,151.1349012203898,159.19961611844158,171.61434972294217,214.15800349438518,374,150.0

So, Ms. Amunson, I want to ask you a question about the degree of, say, inconvenience versus burden, because one of the difficulties in this case is that, you know, the attorney general says that the burden has to be substantial, Mr. Carvin's talking about the ordinary burdens of voting. And there's a difficulty that, you know, the statutory language and its lack of clarity presents in trying to figure out when something crosses from an inconvenience to a burden. You know, on the other side -- and I think some of the hypotheticals that Justice Alito was asking you emphasized this -- I think, you know, your position and its emphasis on any disparity at all risks saying that any election rule, you know, which, as Judge Easterbrook pointed out in his Frank opinion, you know, all election rules are going to make it easier for some to vote than others. So your approach risks ruling them all out. So let me give you an example. What about a rule that the polls close at 7 p.m. and because of socioeconomic reasons, it's harder for minority voters to get to the poll spot before 7 p.m. because of the time, you know, of their work hours in the day?

Lear said that Scott had undermined the basis for patent estoppel even more than Westinghouse had. So it read Westinghouse as undermining the basis for patent estoppel. The world has changed greatly since then, as Justice Breyer pointed out, in terms of employee/employer relations and how these contracts of adhesions are often used against employees.

Foreign law is different. Justice Kagan rightly points that out.

And, further, I mean, Voisine spends as -- as much time talking about the effects of coming out the other way than it does about the text.

822,"Good afternoon, Mr. Feigin. I want to pick up on Justice Gorsuch's point about precedent because we have two precedents we have to make sense of, Leocal and Voisine. And in your brief, I -- I thought the answer that you were giving about the distinction of Leocal -- and this is page 13 of your brief -- ""The Court in Voisine accordingly made clear that the critical distinction recognized in Leocal itself is between accidents and recklessness, not recklessness and knowledge or intention."" In other words, that Leocal stands for the idea that negligence doesn't come within this kind of language.

823,"Exactly. Well, so -- so I'm sorry to interrupt, but the -- the point being that Leocal recognizes the distinction that's traditional: Negligence, out; recklessness and above, per model penal code, is usually considered more important. But you don't have to guess because you have Voisine, I guess, that draws that distinction. And so that's what I thought the distinction was between Leocal and Voisine, but -- as your brief said. The other thing I wanted to get to is the notice point has been raised here. And it seems to me that the notice in this kind of statute is a little bit different, but -- and this is more of a comment, and you can fill in the gaps of it. But we're not talking about notice for committing reckless assault under Tennessee law. What we're talking about is someone who's been convicted three times for separate offenses under Tennessee law, or other state law, who then, after being convicted of three violent felonies, knowing they shouldn't possess firearms, nonetheless possesses firearms on notice they shouldn't possess firearms because they've been convicted of these prior offenses. So you actually have to four times have committed some pretty significant violation before you fall into this statute.

So it seems to me, if we start with the text and we look at ""recognized as eligible,"" we have a choice. Do we read that in its ordinary meaning, as Mr. Clement says, or do we read it as a term of art? And that's a choice we have, and we have to figure out, how do we resolve that? And one of the ways we usually resolve that is looking at the context to see how Congress might have been using the phrase here. And once we broaden out the lens and look at the context, we see the express inclusion of the ANCs and we see that they would be left out completely, meaning many tens of thousands of native Alaskans would be left out completely not only from the CARES Act but from many other social services statutes.

I'm a bit mystified by some of the arguments here because it seems like you're asking us to reinvent the wheel, but it's not a new issue at least as I see it. We decided unanimously in 1956 how to balance property rights against union organizing rights in the Babcock case. And then, of course, in Lechmere, we reiterated that in Justice Thomas's opinion for the Court there. The Babcock briefs, if you go back into those, those are all about property rights against union organizing rights, and then Babcock considers that and -- and sets forth a rule. Now I think you -- you probably prevail under that rule, but I'm -- I'm curious why your argument is not as simple as Justice Clark's -- California Supreme Court Justice Clark's argument in his dissent in the '76 case that you cite where he just says, under Babcock, there's a rule, the Board's regulation here goes beyond the Babcock rule by permitting blanket access under private -- onto private property during worker -- working hours and access when alternative means of communications do, in fact, exist.

I -- I think they're doing constitutional avoidance and constitutional avoidance not to necessarily avoid a potentially unconstitutional but an unconstitutional -- unconstitutionality if the regulation were allowed to go beyond what the Court allowed in Babcock. So, in other words, it seems to me, especially if you go back into the briefs in Babcock, which are all about the Fifth Amendment -- not all about, but they talk a lot about the Fifth Amendment -- that then you read Babcock, it is interpreting the statute as informed by the Constitution and saying, given the constitutional status of the property rights, we're only going to allow this very limited intrusion, again, as Justice Clark says for the California Supreme Court, when alternative means of communication do, in fact, exist, then you can't go onto the property.

We have previously defined or sort of said that that kind of interest has to be a taking that is continuous and indefinite, like taking even an inch of somebody's apartment house to put up a CATV system or taking an easement for the beach. The virtue of their approach is that it's pretty clear, I think, because, otherwise, you get into the mess of saying, well, what about a year? Here, it's 4 percent of all the year's hours and 10 percent or 12 percent of all the daylight hours and -- and -- but it is not government coming in, it's a private person coming in. That's what they say. So what are the rules that distinguish an easement from not? I thought an easement, for example, ran with the land so that if it's no longer agricultural land but, rather, is a -- a steel mill, you can't transfer the easement. It doesn't exist anymore. Nobody can go on the property. There may be other characteristics.

And I think somebody previously asked you about your empirical evidence, and I'll just give you sort of my sense that the empirics here are sparse, maybe surprisingly sparse, as to how this unanimity requirement works with respect to what I take to be the ordinary meaning of ""accuracy,"" which is simply a reduction in the error rate in trials.

And in this case, you know, there's a black defendant. The state uses its peremptory strikes to strike all but one black juror -- uses four of its six peremptories against black venire persons -- strikes five blacks for cause because several of them -- in part, for several of them -- had a family history of incarceration. And you're left with one black juror with a black defendant. And then you get a 11-to-1 verdict on the armed robbery count, the two kidnapping counts -- one of the armed robbery counts, two kidnapping counts, and the rape count. And the one juror is the black -- black woman, the black juror. This case seems like a classic example of what we were concerned about with the combination of peremptory challenges being used on the basis of race, maybe not to strike every juror but to strike all but one, and then the nonunanimous jury system complementing the -- the peremptory challenges.

B says the tabulation of the population that he just took, as required for the apportionment of representatives, that tabulation shall be reported to the Secretary -- by the Secretary to the President. That's the report we're concerned about. That's the tabulation we're concerned about.

So we're not interested in other ways. We're interested in this report, in this tabulation, under 141(b). Now, if I'm right so far, the President's order says I'll tell you why I want that. I want that because it's our policy that illegal aliens will not be included in the census. I can't tell you exactly what ones. It doesn't say that. It just says illegal aliens will not be included. And he asked for the report so he can do that.

It could be that we are dealing with a possibility that is quite important. It could be that this is much ado about very little. It depends on what the Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce are able to do. If I just take the numbers from the district court in D.C.'s opinion last week, they said that the -- the plaintiffs in that case were claiming that there are 10.5 million people in this country who would be counted as being here illegally. But, if you look at the smaller number of -- of those who are held in detention facilities, it's -- it's something like 60,000. The first number could easily change the apportionment of representatives. The second one, it's much more doubtful that it would change the apportionment of representatives. There are only 31 days left in the year. To exclude the 10.5 million seems to me a monumental task, to do that without sampling, to take 300 million plus names and determine individually for each of those people whether they are lawfully in the United States.

So, on the tax, I see this as a Subchapter 68 penalty that, therefore, qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. On Direct Marketing, it seems to me that that's arguably distinct because the penalty there was not a tax. Here, it is so defined as a tax and, therefore, comes within the scope of the Anti-Injunction Act. Then we get to the question -- and there's -- and there's other questions -- but the regulatory tax question, the Bob Jones and Alexander cases, and I want to get your reaction to this, which is I think reading those cases as they are poses a problem for you, but I'm not sure those cases are -- should be read for all they're worth. In other words, I'm wondering whether those cases -- we should back away from some of the implications of those cases for challenges to regulatory taxes for the reasons, some of the reasons you've given here, that it seems somewhat unfair, as it did even in those cases, somewhat unfair to force someone to go through the process that you're talking about here.

1110,"Thank you. And good afternoon, Mr. Bond. I'm going to tell you where I'm -- I think I'm with you and where I think I have a problem. On the text of the Anti-Injunction Act, I think you have a strong argument, Subchapter 68 and how that fits here. This penalty is designated a tax; therefore, it fits within the AIA. Direct Marketing, I think you have a good point. That was not subject -- that penalty was not denominated a tax and, therefore, the reason the two cases would be different is that the text of the statutes is different. You make a good point there, I think. In terms of the Regan point, how you would do this, you say you file a letter objecting to it, and you then have post- -- you have proceedings after the IRS assesses the penalty. That all makes sense to me as well. The criminal point, Justice Alito's point, you just said the Court could flat-out say that it's not a willful violation when you're challenging the reporting requirement being unlawful. So that -- we could -- we could say that. Here's where I think I have a concern: On Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander, those cases, you were having a discussion with Justice Kagan, either/or, are you challenging the regulatory aspect of this or the reporting aspect of this, or are you challenging the tax aspect? I think you're challenging both as a plaintiff really. And what Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander seem to say -- and this supports you -- is that when you're doing that, you have to go -- the AIA applies. And I -- I agree with you that those cases support you. But I also think Justice Gorsuch makes a very good point that the current philosophy that's -- those cases are from a different era. The current philosophy of challenging administrative action is different, as the Chief Justice said, with presumptions. And, here, where I really think Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander may be different is when the penalties are so high if you lose. In other words, you have to bet, and if you bet and lose, penalties are so high that it's going to deter you from challenging the regulatory or reporting aspect in the first place. So the bottom -- long-wind up, bottom-line question. Shouldn't -- as a matter of fairness, modern era of administrative law, presumptions, shouldn't we carve out an exception from Bob Jones, Alexander, Bailey, when the penalties for trying to challenge something are so high that it's going to be coercive and effectively deter you from bringing this kind of challenge in the first place?",Brett_M_Kavanaugh,19-930,36,3185.515,3347.535,3186,3348,5.19931372483928,0.13573000288079606,0.0013152495842556065,144.30989148811935,163.86452094349724,178.6955271983718,197.13312122062953,254.17759331190004,451,162.01999999999998

Please assume with me the following: Assume that the -- what you read, the computer -- computer programs which do something, after all, are copyrightable, but then it says methods of operation are not, whether they're computer programs or not. The problem for us is, is this more like Baker v. Selden, where they said the accounting is not, it's a method of operation? Or is it more like an ordinary computer program? All right. Now what I got out of reading through this very good briefing is, look, Java's people divided the universe of tasks, of which there are billions, in a certain way. All the things that tell the computer to do one of those things, we'll do. But that which tells the computer which to do, that's the declaration. Here is what it's like. It's like, as Judge Boudin said, the QWERTY keyboard. You didn't have to have a QWERTY keyboard on typewriters at the beginning, but, my God, if you let somebody have a copyright on that now, they would control all typewriters, which really has nothing to do with copyright. Or it's like switchboards on old-fashioned telephone systems. You could have done it in 1,000 ways. But, once you did it, all those operators across the world learned that system, and you don't want to give a copyright holder a monopoly of -- hmm -- telephone systems. Or it's like, to use the Chief Justice's example, a chef who figures out brilliant ways of mixing spices and then putting the spices for this and that in a certain order on a shelf, and then he writes something that tells you which shelf to go to and which shelf to pick out and which spice to pick out for which dish. Now all those things are somewhat ordinary programs, but they also are doing something. They're giving you an instruction as to how to call up those programs that reflect Java's organization. And at this point in time, it's really tough, just like the QWERTY keyboard, to go backwards, and very bad consequences will flow if you don't see that distinction. Okay?

1139,"Counsel, at the -- in your beginning statement, you had the sky falling if we ruled in favor of Google. The problem with that argument for me is that it seems that since 1992, and Justice Kagan mentioned the case, the Second Circuit case, a Ninth Circuit case, an Eleventh Circuit case, a First Circuit case, that a basic principle has developed in the case law, up until the Federal Circuit's decision. I know there was a Third Circuit decision earlier on in the 1980s. But the other circuits moved away from that. They and the entire computer world have not tried to analogize computer codes to other methods of expression because it's sui generis. They've looked at its functions, and they've said the API, the Application Programming Interface, of which the declaring code is a part, is not copyrightable. Implementing codes are. And on that understanding, industries have built up around applications that know they can -- they can copy only what's necessary to run on the application, but they have to change everything else. That's what Google did here. That's why it took less than 1 percent of the Java code. So I guess that's the way the world has run in every other system, whether it's Apple's desktop or Amazon's web services, everybody knows that APIs are not -- declaring codes are not copyrightable.

1173,"Mr. Waxman, it seems to me you -- you start in a place that I -- I can readily sign up to, which is that joint ventures often need to have agreements that would otherwise look anticompetitive, whether they're territorial allocations or price agreements, in order to create a product that wouldn't otherwise exist. And we usually give that a pretty quick look, maybe even a twinkling of the eye. So that all -- that all makes sense to me, and we certainly don't want to go back to the bad old days of reviewing any joint venture agreement that restricts competition through per se analysis or -- or something that looks like a strict scrutiny analysis, which I understand you condemn the -- the Ninth Circuit for doing. So I understand all of that. I think the trick comes for me at least sort of where Justice Kagan was alluding to, which is, here, the agreement that's really at the center of the case is an agreement among competitors to fix price with the labor market, where you have monopsony control, and that's unusual. The normal joint venture is -- is in a competitive market. But, here, the NCAA has monopsony control over labor price. There aren't other leagues which might compete with the NCAA that might allow payments, and you could test consumer demand that way.

1175,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Waxman. I want to pick up from Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch and identify some issues of concern to me as I look at this. I start from the idea that the antitrust laws should not be a cover for exploitation of the student-athletes, so that is a concern, a overarching concern here. I see your rhetoric and tradition and history argument being very similar to the arguments that were made for exempting baseball from the antitrust laws, Flood v. Kuhn, Federal -- Federal Baseball, and that -- that exemption has not been replicated in other sports in other cases. And then, in Regents, as Justice Kagan said, that really was from a different era, it -- it was dicta, not sure it was fully considered dicta, and, in any event, from a different era. So then we get to regular antitrust law, rule of reason, and I just want to drill down on your asserted procompetitive justification and how you say the product is differentiated. It does seem, as Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch suggested, Justice Alito, that schools are conspiring with competitors, agreeing with competitors, I'll say that, to pay no salaries to the workers who are making the schools billions of dollars on the theory that consumers want the schools to pay their workers nothing. And that just seems entirely circular and even somewhat disturbing. And then, as Justice Kagan says, it's not even factually supported in the record in this case. It seems to blend back to the tradition argument, and all things circle back to this idea, well, it should just -- just don't worry about it, college athletics is different, just like baseball.

There's a heightened risk that this person is going to sneak away before the house can be surrounded. One of the briefs says it takes six to eight officers to surround the house waiting for a warrant. There's a heightened risk that evidence is going to be destroyed, a heightened risk that the person is going to barricade himself in the house, get a gun, and resist the execution of a warrant.

1231,"Counsel, I've been listening to the exchange with my colleagues involving the difficulty in deciding what's a felony and what's a misdemeanor. Part of the problem is that what are felonies are no longer absolutely, necessarily, and in all situations dangerous crimes. You can have white-collar crimes where there is no danger. You can have all sorts of environmental crimes, other things that don't cause -- that don't create exigency in the same sense that Santana was announcing the rule or that the common law came from. And so I don't know why anybody is arguing that there's a difference between felony and misdemeanors and why we're recognizing a categorical rule at all. Why isn't the better reading just that hot pursuit is a type of exigent circumstance that can but does not always justify warrantless entry, regardless of whether the underlying offense is a felony or misdemeanor? If you look at our holding in Santana, we talked about all of the circumstances that would make it likely that a drug dealer would destroy evidence once they saw the police officer on -- on the scene. Our next case, Stanton, was not about whether or not the issue was a felony or not. It was -- the issue was, was the situation such as to justify, reasonably, entry?

I guess that cuts both ways, though, because one could say, well, you don't need a categorical rule because you already have the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine that covers all the things that justify the categorical rule. So I guess I'm wondering what the real difference in practice would be between a world where we have a categorical rule and a world where we allow all the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine cases to apply as they exist now.",Brett_M_Kavanaugh,20-18,54,4800.835,4867.405,4801,4867,5.1527141152561535,0.11482075278820755,0.0012917750264493575,145.14587018501834,159.19961611844158,168.66611791365605,186.06888929891866,223.84553226259098,181,66.56999999999971
1258,"Let me ask you a question now about methodology, a word, the original meaning of the term ""unreasonable"" in the Fourth Amendment. It seems to me that's a different kind of term than ""search"" or ""seizure"" or ""cruel and unusual,"" and ""unreasonable"" means unreasonable. So what we're really talking about is not original meaning or original intent or even original expected application because I don't -- I'm not aware of anyone in the first Congress or in the state ratifying processes that said ""unreasonable"" means the common law, unlike -- and the text is unlike the Seventh Amendment, which refers to the common law expressly. And Professor Lafave and others have pointed this out. So it's not really original meaning or even original intent. It's more like presumed original expected applications, like a Justice Douglas-style interpretation.

The other option's a categorical rule for both. And I asked Ms. Rice about this, what would be the difference in the real world. She said, as you said, clear rules for officers. But I wonder if the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine, in other words, the first option, really wouldn't provide, you know, not as clear a rule but still a pretty clear rule for officers because the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine really, as I see it, tracks common sense, these are the kinds of cases and the kinds of reasons an officer would do this in the first place, want to go into the house without a warrant, especially escape of the suspect, threats to others, destruction of evidence. So I guess I'm not sure what's gained by a categorical rule.

1306,"General Mooppan, you have a lot of history on your side, but I think I want to give you a theory about why that history is not very relevant. I think that these cases that you have fall into three groups. The one are they are declaratory judgment actions in a world before declaratory judgment actions. In other words, they're ways to try to determine legal rights going forward before the declaratory judgment form existed. The second group of cases are cases in which there's injury that's hard to monetize, and -- and these cases are asking for something to recompense that injury. But the reason why those cases aren't very relevant anymore is that, in our world, we monetize those claims all the time. We now live in a world, unlike the historical world, in which we acknowledge claims for emotional distress, claims for dignitary harms of all kinds, which makes the nominal damages claim unnecessary. The third group of cases is a case in which what the plaintiff really wants is vindication. It's a statement that I'm right, the defendant is wrong. And as to those cases, modern Article III jurisprudence says that, you know, you don't -- that's not a case or controversy.

So they'd lose out, people like Ms. Swift and groups like that.

Emotional harm and distress is a particular example. Areas where it's difficult to quantify damages and expensive to do so require a large enough damage to justify the effort.

But it seems to me that, in your responses to Justice Alito's questions, Justice Kagan's questions, Justice Gorsuch's questions, you've kind of gone back and forth on the triviality of the money point.

But, of course, our precedents say that, you know, even -- even a small amount is enough. And so, in the Taylor Swift example or in Justice Gorsuch's bus fare example, I -- I heard you -- at least I took you to concede that even a very trivial amount would constitute a compensatory injury under Article III.

She asked you to distinguish between what would happen if they filed within the five-year period in which they would know whether the risk had materialized or outside the five-year period, say in the sixth year. I want to know what would happen, say, if they filed in year two, but the litigation drags on and on and on and the case doesn't come to its conclusion until year six. So, if I understand your response to Justice Kagan, it would essentially mean that people had standing at the outset of the suit. But, if they were in the 50 percent that were home-free, they would lose their standing by the end? I mean, that just seems like an odd way to think about it since we normally judge standing at the outset, and when something dissipates over the course of a suit, we think about it in terms of mootness, not that the injury isn't concrete.

1424,"Okay. Let me ask you about material risk of harm. So, as I read Spokeo, you know, and it cites Clapper after that language, it preserves, you know, the possibility of standing in a prospective suit where harm is imminent but hasn't yet happened. And then, for slander per se, you know, there are some harms that were recognized at the common law, as we have discussed during this argument, that were presumed to cause harm because, even if you didn't have to prove that you lost a job over it, you know, that the risk was so great that in and of itself the common law tort proposed it. And it seems like this case is about whether, even going beyond that, a big risk that the tort would actually happen to you is itself a tort. And I -- I haven't heard you disclaim that as a proper reading of Spokeo.

I think you have a good argument with respect to the 1,853 in terms of the reasonable procedures, but I'm more concerned about the 6,332, whose information was not, in essence, published. Under -- in Spokeo, of course, the information was published, which is a big distinction, as I see it, between that case and this, as to the 6,332. And when Spokeo talked then about risk of harm, it was talking about harm beyond the publication, at least as I understood it, for example, publication of ZIP codes, which strikes me as a very different thing than risk -- talking about risk of harm when there hasn't been publication to begin with. So that -- that's point one. And then, on -- on risk of harm, you heard me talk about damages versus injunctive relief. It strikes me that risk of harm, of course, is enough to get you injunctive relief. With damages, I -- I hadn't thought risk of harm would get you damages -- standing for damages claims unless the risk of harm was itself a harm. Judge Tatel in the D.C. Circuit analogized it: If inaccurate information falls into a database, does it make a sound? And his answer to that, applying Stoke -- Spokeo, was no. And I guess then-Judge Barrett, talking about no harm/no foul, seemed to be picking up on the same thing.

And you're willing to have them say, but taking gay into account, you don't have to take it into account at all, but they don't want to do that. Now that seems to me a very narrow ground for deciding a case that has enormous implications.

1528,"Good morning, Mr. Katyal. I have kind of a bigger picture thought to express, and you can react as -- as you wish. It seems like this case requires us to think about the balance between two very important rights recognized by this Court, the religious exercise and belief right, obviously, in the First Amendment, and the same-sex marriage right, as recognized in Obergefell. And it seems when those rights come into conflict, all levels of government should be careful and should often, where possible and appropriate, look for ways to accommodate both interests in reasonable ways. It's a very -- you know it's very sensitive, controversial. There are strong -- very strong feelings on all sides that warrant respect. And it seems like we and governments should be looking, where possible, for win-win answers, recognizing that neither side is going to win completely on these issues given the First Amendment on the one hand and given Obergefell on the other. But, when I look at this case, that's not at all what happened here. It seems like Philadelphia created a clash, it seems, and was looking for a fight and has brought that serious, controversial fight all the way to the Supreme Court even though no same-sex couple had gone to CSS, even though 30 agencies are available for same-sex couples, and even though CSS would refer any same-sex couple to one of those other agencies. And to be clear, I fully appreciate the stigmatic harm. I completely understand that, fully appreciate it. But we need to find a balance that also respects religious beliefs. That was the promise explicitly written by the Court in Obergefell and in Masterpiece, explicitly promised that respect for religious beliefs.

1583,"Good morning, Mr. Nielson. A -- a lot of your remedial argument seems to hinge on the happenstance that we had an acting director at the time of the Third Amendment's adoption. I -- I'd like to highlight two potential difficulties with that and ask for your thoughts. The first is the assumption that the acting director is answerable to the President while the director is not. Under the statute creating this outfit, the director appoints deputy directors, the director, not the President. It appears that those deputy directors would be insulated from the President therefore. And when -- when the director steps aside, he names the acting director, or, rather, he gives a pool of three of his deputies and the President chooses which of those three. But the director appointed all three of them. So I'm not sure in what sense or where we get the inference or how we generate from some penumbra emanating somewhere that the President has the removal power over this acting director. That's one. And two is, let's -- let's box in that, let's assume that's the case. So what? The -- the plaintiffs here challenged actions after -- during this whole period, including after a period in which the acting director disappeared and we now have a director. You say, well, that -- that -- that doesn't matter because the amendment is a thing that was adopted by the acting director. But the plaintiffs are challenging the director's actions as void because he is unanswerable to the President. So why wouldn't we at least be able to provide relief voiding the director's actions once we had a -- a -- a Senate-confirmed director in 2014?",Neil_Gorsuch,19-422,35,2917.64,3034.75,2918,3035,5.518498331831708,0.7908026419483155,0.001483451985170737,108.64886354298083,131.1927691590824,163.86452094349724,593.3133541604705,949.3936665479674,283,117.11000000000013

As you say and I think helpful for you, the context here is a team and a coach, not the school more generally. But, as a judge and maybe as a coach and a parent too, it seems like maybe a bit of over -- overreaction by the coach. So my reaction when I read this, she's competitive, she cares, she blew off steam like millions of other kids have when they're disappointed about being cut from the high school team or not being in the starting lineup or not making all league. And just by way of comparison about -- and to show how much it means to people, you know, arguably, the greatest basketball player of all time is inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009 and gives a speech, and what does he talk about? He talks about getting cut as a sophomore from the varsity team. And he wasn't joking. He was critical 30 years later. It still -- it still bothered him. And I think that's just emblematic of how much it means to kids to make a high school team. It is so important to their lives, and coaches sweat the cuts, and it guts coaches to have to cut a kid who's on the bubble, and -- and good coaches understand the importance and they understand the emotions. So maybe what bothers me when I read all this is that it didn't seem like the punishment was tailored to the offense given what I just said about how important it is and you know how much it means to the kids.

1634,"Good morning, Ms. Blatt. So let me -- let -- let's assume that I think about the case in the following way, you know, that high school students enjoy the same free speech rights as everyone else. Tinker acknowledged that in the context of the -- once you cross the schoolhouse gate, those rights are somewhat reduced because of the school environment and the need to, you know, control and avoid substantial disruption, but they're not lost altogether, but that nothing in Tinker suggests itself that it applies outside of the school environment. And so what you're asking us to do is to extend the school's authority that Tinker acknowledges outside of the school environment. And I think you have good policy reasons for doing that.

But your three-part test certainly has its own issues. You know, it's not going to be easy to apply, and I think a lot of the questions that you've gotten today show a concern, including in this case, that schools abuse this authority and that they punish things that maybe don't cause substantial disruption or political speech or religious speech that they shouldn't or -- you know, I think you've heard a lot of skepticism about whether the speech at issue in this case actually caused substantial disruption. So I -- I -- I -- I guess my concern is, if we have two -- two tests being offered or on offer, neither one is going to be easy to apply in all cases, they'll both have hard cases, which one ought we apply? Which one is the more protective of speech? And -- and let me ask you this: Insofar as the policy concerns go, nothing in the First Amendment prohibits soft discipline, right, like, in this case, the cheerleader coming to school and being told -- rather than being kicked off the team and punished, being told we're aware of the Snapchat, this is not good for team cohesion, this is not respectful of your coaches, if we see any of this kind of behavior on the field or at practice or undermining morale, there is going to be a consequence but not imposing one yet.

1656,"Thank you. The difficulty I have I've already mentioned. A few years ago, a superintendent of schools, I think in San Francisco, said, you know, schools have changed a lot, the public schools, since when I went there. He said, today we don't just teach classical subjects. We're there to help the child have adequate health, in many cases, to see that he's adequately fed. In quite a few cases, we become a caretaker, and we don't want to send them home immediately because there's nobody home, and we have to plan after-school activities. There are dozens of areas that didn't used to be thought of as within the purview of the public school. Today, in many places, they are. Now add to that the Internet and the Internet not just listening to teachers but also doing homework and also writing papers, sometimes vaguely defined and sometimes and sometimes. Well, how do I get a standard out of that? I'm frightened to death of writing a standard. And Tinker, after all, doesn't really write a standard. It just says you can't regulate school unless it substantially disrupts or hurts somebody else. It doesn't say if it does that you can do anything you want. You still must use some kind of test, like proportionality or something else, and I can mention that often outside of school it's the parents' job, not the teachers' if, by the way, there are parents in the house, et cetera, and I can mention the differences and say take those into account.

1657,"Mr. Cole, there is a huge gap between the broad and very important free speech issues that have been briefed and discussed this morning and the particular incident involved in this case. If we're going to address the broad issues, then I, for one, think we need clear rules that protect freedom of speech. On the other hand, if the Court, having decided to take this case, wants to decide it without addressing those broad issues, of course, the Court could dismiss the case, and I assume you wouldn't have an objection to that. But, if the Court doesn't do that, could the Court do something along these lines: Say Tinker applies in school.

The level at which speech has to arrive to meet those standards is very, very high, and I'm dubious that most of the conduct that teenagers engage in would fit any of our traditional categories. So let's talk about harassment, okay? A common episode, I think I read it in a newspaper, a young girl is subjected to -- each time she goes out of the house, whether she's in the playground, not the school playground, or walking to school with a group of classmates walking by and saying, you're so ugly, why are you even alive? That's not a true threat. They're not threatening her with any bodily harm. It is not harassment if that's all -- if they're just speaking.

And your choice is this: If you -- you could choose to either tighten Tinker or you can say, well, we're going to assume Tinker is out of control on campus, but we will leave open season on schools and complete chaos as to what their test allows. Under their view, all 50 states define bullying in terms of Tinker.

I think Mr. Cole said it's the Tinker test, but he's afraid to use the Tinker word because it's scary, and it shouldn't be. You're much better off cleaning this doctrine up. Justice Kagan, you had amazing questions about school speech. Remember, our test is the audience has to be the school, so all of your speech, if it's to the press, the police, your pastor, your family, et cetera, none of that is school speech even if it involves a school topic. Justice Barrett, on threats, the facts in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Bell, nobody knew whether that was a threat. The police were sort of involved. It is not fair to the parents of those other kids to have schools fumbling around. Well, I don't know what this applies before we had Tinker, part of the threats were on campus, part were off, it was on the Internet. Let's look at where she drafted it, maybe she was to and from. Now let's move to the school supervision: madness, confusion, and chaos. Please don't do this to schools. Mr. Cole said you could prevent swearing to and from school. That's nuts. You're in the dad's minivan. That's school supervision under their view. No one thinks Fraser applies there, and yet all of a sudden, when you get out of the minivan and I guess walking to it, but maybe it depends on how far you park, Tinker is going in and out of coverage, that rule makes no sense. There's no case law on conduct that aids and abets school speech. You will have a school speech petition.

1720,"Counsel, I think Justice Scalia would have agreed with you in his -- by his dissent in Neder. But putting that aside, I have two questions that I hope you'll get to in my time. The first is I don't know that the focus of prong 3 and prong 4 are the same. Prong 3, I think, clearly is related to the proceeding at issue: Would he have been found guilty? But prong 4 is talking more broadly about the public's perception of the judicial system as qua system. And so I don't know that the answer to your question is the same with respect to prong 3 and prong 4. I understand your argument that whether this proceeding would have been different, yes, under prong 3, and so that you may have shown prejudice, but, with respect to prong 4, I think that what the public would be looking at, qua the judge as well, is the entire proceeding. And, there, I don't see why a judge can't look at the facts of -- of a particular case from beginning to end to determine whether the public would have seen this as an injustice. And given all of the circumstances or potential circumstances, some of which are just like this case, that Justice Alito mentioned, your defendant was just released from prison six months before he was arrested for this charge, and he had served either 20 months or 36 months, it's impossible to believe that there's any reasonable doubt that he could have put his knowledge in contention.

But I take -- I go a step further. Assuming that because nobody thought knowledge was at issue, that evidence had never made it into the record, I'm not sure that you could present it.

1725,"Well, I'm -- I'm really not so concerned about Neder as the principle that we often conduct as appellate judges a prejudice analysis of trial court errors, and we don't think of that as usurping the Sixth Amendment function of the jury because we're dealing with a forfeited error. And it's the forfeiture that -- that cuts the Gordian knot of the Sixth Amendment concern. That's normally how we conceive of it. That's how the government conceives of it. You obviously see it differently, and I just want to understand how.",Neil_Gorsuch,19-8709,12,1405.48,1437.96500005,1405,1438,4.793766423842776,0.07987656654655896,0.0014793265121527245,108.97590590364099,110.4779176380979,119.95585059317834,125.6544025122524,140.29642857006783,91,32.48500005000005
1726,"But that's -- but that -- that's due to the forfeiture, the government would say, and -- and -- and that -- that's what allows, again, whether it's in the trial record or out of the trial record, us as appellate judges to conduct a prejudice analysis without infringing the jury's functions.",Neil_Gorsuch,19-8709,13,1447.87,1465.08500005,1448,1465,4.876835781263006,0.08441229735011509,0.0003746559567838756,116.28587433821606,121.87689905510024,132.33275396903284,135.6220140113352,152.34504000321198,52,17.21500005000007

1728,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Ms. Guagliardo. I want to focus on the Old Chief stipulation. I think your argument has to be as a matter of theory that your client might have been acquit -- acquitted if proper instructions had been given because he did not know that he'd committed those qualifying felonies. That at least has to be the theory. And the government says the Old Chief stipulation is really quite inconsistent with any such theory and prevented the government from introducing evidence about the felonies, which would, as the government says, reinforce the natural inference that the defendant was undoubtedly aware of that criminal record when he possessed the gun. And other courts have pointed out it's not something you're likely to forget to begin with.

You know, you've gotten a lot of questions today pointing out the distinction between step 3 and step 4 in the plain-error analysis, you know, and Justice Alito was asking you questions about, you know, what if the defendant had written a book about his experience as a felon and on and on. In your view, do steps 3 and 4 do anything distinct? Because then the government's pointed out, and I think many of the questions you've gotten show, that step 3 maybe has a jury focus, but step 4 doesn't have anything to do with what the jury would think. It has to do more with what the public would think. Do you see them as having any kind of different function, or, essentially, under your analysis, do we just stop at step 3 because, if it would have led to a different result, then there's no need really to do anything different in step 4?",Amy_Coney_Barrett,19-8709,16,1697.73,1747.45,1698,1747,5.538287586290919,0.1496882150315612,0.0021315381109764326,207.65234878997256,227.75828324510303,242.6993408760242,273.99891691894106,366.5921692404736,168,49.72000000000003

I mean, I -- I have a pretty good intuitive idea, I think. You don't want to be unfair. You don't want to go too far. You have to recognize the comparative expertise of appeals courts and district courts. You have to understand the difficulty of getting evidence, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

You sort of looked at what Congress had in mind and -- and figured out the meaning in light of that. And, of course, today, we have a more disciplined approach, you know, I think more suited to our role under the Constitution. But shouldn't we construe this statute in the environment in which Congress passed it in light of the, as I said, more free-wheeling approach? And I think there'd be a lot more leeway to your friend on the other side argument about an expansive reading of some of the language.

So suppose one of those members said, well, here, we're going to authorize the Commission to seek an injunction, so I'm going to look at the most recent edition of Black's Law Dictionary, which defines an injunction in part as ""a judicial process operating in personam and requiring a person to whom it is directed to do or refrain from doing a particular thing.""

So the more important question for me is -- and I hope you can answer it -- is, why would Congress authorize the FTC to seek a permanent injunction if no other equitable remedies were available?

1772,"History matters. I think Justice Brandeis, when he started, was faced with a business community that was very suspicious of the FTC's power and thought it would be abused and a progressive community that thought it's absolutely necessary to bring bad business practices under control. So they compromised. The compromise was you've got to do what the FTC says, but before it tells you to do something, it will find that what you're doing now is wrong. It will find that. It will be a cease-and-desist order, later expanded under Moss-Magnuson, I think, to include violation of a rule. So Section 5, cease-and-desist order or violation of a rule, ha, damage of some kind. Nineteen, the same thing. And now we have right in the middle 13, no protection like that whatsoever. Do not worry, says the FTC, we will only use it in exceptional cases. Ha! In 2012, they repeal that. And now, 10 years later, after this has been in effect for a few years, I read that 100 cases under this provision are in the courts, compared with 10 or 12 under the regular cases. And you say it's just obvious, we're going to get those people who think their bad conduct is obvious. Look at Skechers. Look at the Cardinal case. Go back to the famous Unburn case. Add substantiation. People wouldn't know that it is an unfair practice that a chiropractor who was married to a wife who had some income from the company and therefore is a conclusion as to the muscle toning of the company should be discounted. And that's the kind of case they're bringing now. Now do you see my point? On the one hand, it's well-established law in the lower court. On the other hand, if we interpret it your way, we -- we -- we say your fears, business community, were absolutely right. It is now up to the FTC. Before you know the thing is wrong, they hit you with bad damages. This case? Perhaps you're right. But Skechers, Cardinal, even Unburn, build strong bodies eight ways, that was Wonder Bread.

1782,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Marcus. Good to be with you again. I want to pick up on Justice Alito's question and Mr. FitzGerald's article, which I've read. You obviously put forward good arguments on Porter and the Court's precedent and Congress's intent, as well as the body of court of appeals cases, but it seems that the problem you have is the text. And in that sense, this case really is a separation of powers case. I -- I -- I worked in the Executive Branch for many years, so I understand how this happens. When you're in the Executive Branch or an independent agency, you want to do good things and prevent or punish bad things, and sometimes your statutory authority is borderline. And it could be war policy or immigration or environmental or what have you, but with good intentions, the agency pushes the envelope and stretches the statutory language to do the good or prevent the bad. The problem is -- is it results in a transfer of power from Congress to the Executive Branch to decide whether to exercise this new authority. That's a particular concern, at least for me, with independent agencies. So -- now why isn't the answer here, for the agency to seek this new authority for Congress, for us to maintain the principle that separation of powers, that the agency should stick to the authority in the -- in the text and not -- and not go beyond that?

I would -- I would have thought that the way to do this is to start by figuring out what is the decision, capital D decision, and then everything that led up to that decision is -- is predecisional. And that would be a pretty simple formula. And, obviously, there would be case -- questions in some cases about what the decision is.

First, the agency officials who are engaged in deliberations need to be able to speak with candor, as Justice Gorsuch was just saying. Second, FOIA officers, who are rampant throughout the executive branch, spend an enormous amount of time and resources on FOIA, could use clarity. And then district court judges in the District of Columbia and elsewhere, if you talk to, would lament the lack of clarity and clear rules in -- in FOIA cases.

1877,"Now I also think that First Options rests heavily and basically repeats AT&T, so I've read AT&T about five times. What it seems to say is, if you have a question, parties, or one of them, whether this dispute falls under the terms of the contract that have arbitration for 1 -- paragraphs 1 through 7 or is rather a Section 10 dispute, where there is no arbitration clearly, you don't know if it's a Section 8 or a Section 10, well, what happens? What AT&T says is, but that is a question of arbitrability. It is a question whether this dispute is arbitrable. So it's for the judge. But where there is an arbitration clause in the contract, as there was in First Options as far as the owners knew, but where there is a -- where there is an arbitration clause, then there is a presumption of arbitrability. All right? So that seems to me, Judge, you decide. You decide whether this particular dispute is sent to an arbitrator or -- or for the court, i.e., is it arbitrable, you decide, Judge, but if there's an arbitration clause in the contract, you decide with the presumption of arbitrability that it will normally be arbitrable. That's what it seems to say. And so the judge was right to decide it below, but he didn't decide it right because he should have given it a presumption of arbitrability. Now that's how I read those two cases, but also in the back of my mind is what in heaven's name happens in labor arbitration. In the ordinary labor arbitration case -- and that's where all this law comes from -- where -- one party, the labor union, says this is a Section 8 agreement, arbitrate it. No, says the employer. It is a Section 10 kind of situation grievance and, therefore, it falls within the exception, don't arbitrate it. How do they decide that?

Then we have an exception to that presumption, which is the First Options rule. When the matter deals with arbitrability, we actually presume that the Court is supposed to decide those gateway questions. So, for whatever reason, we have those presumptions. The Court has said many times that we have those presumptions. Then, as I understand what the Petitioner is saying, he's saying, now let's add a third presumption. The third presumption is, if we see evidence of any delegation, then we should assume that the parties meant to delegate all arbitrability questions. So, if there's any delegation of arbitrability, there's complete delegation of arbitrability. That's the presumption. And he says that presumption should operate because it wouldn't make sense to do partial delegations of arbitrability.

1913,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And, Mr. Geyser, good afternoon. First, picking up on Justice Sotomayor's questions on the incorporation of the AAA rules, you -- that's not the issue before us, but just to pause on that for a second, you referred to it as an elephant in a mouse hole. But it's really an elephant in an elephant hole. When you look at the AAA rules, Rule 7(a) says, ""the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim."" That's very broad language, which is probably why every court of appeals to address this said that the AAA rules are an express delegation. But, again, we don't have to decide that here. That's just the premise. But I wanted to just pause on the elephant in -- in a mouse hole point. Here's -- here's the problem I think I have with your argument, and you've made it very cleverly and persuasively, but the problem is that you are suggesting that the way parties divide up arbitration -- namely, some subjects will be subject to arbitration and decided by an arbitrator and some subjects won't -- also applies to the question of who decides arbitrability. So courts will decide whether certain things are arbitrable or not, and arbitrators will decide whether other things are arbitrable. I think that's what you're saying. But that's just not how it works in the real world, nor could it realistically work that way in the real world. I don't think any contract says arbitrability shall be -- of certain subjects shall be decided by the arbitrator and others -- of other subjects by the court. Can you help me on that? Am I wrong?",Brett_M_Kavanaugh,19-963,41,3459.14,3577.27,3459,3577,5.18202511539809,0.11450920578212079,0.001222812191464494,146.8323839587038,163.86452094349724,176.64303400994282,189.3213161937526,235.7901617579845,293,118.13000000000011

You have to prove that those -- that small number would include people who didn't enroll for Medicaid and didn't enroll for CHIPs when it was a legal requirement as a tax, but they would do so now after they're told there's no penalty for it, there's no tax for it. At some point, common sense seems to me would say: Huh? There's only a small number of people who would do it. That small number of people have to include Medicaid and CHIP recipients to affect you as the state at all.

I'm not sure this wolf comes as a wolf, Mr. Stewart, but I still think it may be a wolf, as Justice Scalia famously said, and he said, in those cases, it can be discerned by careful and perceptive analysis. So here's why -- here -- here's the sources of my concern on that front. First, this structure is a real break from tradition, which we've said in cases like Free Enterprise Fund and many others, perhaps the most telling indication of a constitutional problem is the departure -- the lack of historical precedent. The lack of agency review of the ALJ decision by someone who's appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate is absent here and is ordinarily present and historically has been present. And then, second, the lack of accountability, as the Chief Justice said and Justice Gorsuch was just saying, these are multimillion, sometimes billion-dollar decisions being made not by someone who's accountable in the usual way that the Appointments Clause demands. And the director, on rehearing, does not have the unilateral power to reverse. So, you know, if Congress is going to do that, they can eliminate agency review and prevent removal at will, then it's easy to make these AL -- APJs presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed.

So, you know, the federal -- well, think about -- one unusual thing about the remedy here is that it's not one specific provision in this statutory scheme that's being challenged as unconstitutional. It's the way that they work together. You know, so we could, if we decided that it was unconstitutional, perhaps make all of the APJs subject to -- say they're principal officers, and so they have to be subject to presidential appointment, senatorial confirmation.

But I -- I have a problem with our jurisprudence as -- as it's developed in this hand -- in -- in these cases. And the founding generation conceived of principal officers as synonymous with heads of departments. In early debates and enactments that structured executive department, heads of the department were -- were referred to as principal officers and other members as inferior officers. There's a whole history that many of those inferior officers took final decisions in a wide variety of areas. Yet that's the way we proceeded. The history also shows that early statutes gave non-principal officers the power to make final adjudicatory decisions on behalf of the executive. Your opposing counsel pointed out that as early as 1793, non-principal officers were given the power to adjudicate patent disputes, and in 1803, land commissioners were given the power to make final determinations as to a claimant's right to a tract of land. I personally read this history as suggesting that principal officers were intended to be policymakers, and individuals who merely adjudicated claims based on said policies were not principal officers. So, for me, the person that has to be held responsible is not the individual ILJ -- or ALJ who is making a decision. It's the person who creates the policy. And for me, it's clear that APJs are not policymakers. All of the policies are vested in the director. Precedential power is put in the director. The ALJs cannot influence the course of the law. That's only the director.

2101,"Yeah. Thank you. Go back for a minute to the late 1940s, early 1950s. Most of the natural gas was in the Permian Basin in Oklahoma and in Texas, and they were on the verge of or had built pipelines to carry that natural gas to California, San Diego, El Paso Natural Gas, or up to Pennsylvania, over to Illinois, up to Massachusetts. A lot of the states -- not a lot, but some were objecting in a whole variety of complex ways. And so Congress passed the Natural Gas Act. Now they couldn't have built the pipelines unless they had this power, I think, I'm not certain of that, but I don't see how they could have because they need -- go look at the map on the -- the map of waterways in which Pennsylvania claims an interest in the Marcellus Shale Coalition. They zone water beds. They own all kinds of obstacles. But this was passed to build a pipeline. How could they have done it? I don't see it. And having known a little bit about that, since you need the federal power or a government power to -- for a private person to use eminent domain for anything against a private land or by a state, I don't understand how they would have -- how any reasonable person would have delegated any eminent-domain power to the Natural Gas Act, which was for interstate pipelines, without including the power to proceed against the state. Am I right about that? And, if I am right and, therefore, it is clearly in this statute, why in heaven's name can't the Federal Power Commission then, or FERC now, have done the same thing? And if they could have done the same thing under law of Congress, why can't they hire somebody, just as Mississippi hires private prosecutors sometimes in criminal cases? Or there are dozens of examples where private persons are delegated under supervision, and, here, the supervision is close, to go and do something that the public can do by bringing a criminal case, et cetera, et cetera.

2150,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Henkel. You make what I think are forceful separation-of-powers arguments, particularly that Congress has provided for cross-deputization, and that was not taken advantage of here. So I take that point, and that's an important one for me. But, at the same time, a couple other thoughts that I'll throw out there, and then you can react to them. The amicus brief from the former U.S. Attorneys says that ""criminal jurisdiction in Indian country is an indefensible morass of complex, conflicting, and illogical commands layered in over decades via congressional policies and court decisions and without the consent of tribal nations."" And I don't think you're going to disagree with that description necessarily, and so that leads me to think that one of the things we should be trying to do here is -- is to do no harm because there's lots of ripple effects from a broad decision. And with that in mind, there are statements in our decisions in Duro and Strate that really cut directly against you, as you're -- you're well aware. And you can say those are dicta, and that might be correct, but those have guided the law -- law enforcement for several decades. I think Congress and the executive could reasonably rely on those statements in the Court's decision. Certainly, the Cohen treatise treats those statements as authoritative in terms of guidance. So why isn't the best thing we can do here just to stick with what we said in those cases? It's not very analytically satisfying, but it's a narrow result that does not make a morass, as it was described, any worse. What do you think?",Brett_M_Kavanaugh,19-1414,33,3467.395,3575.78,3467,3576,5.112164674956348,0.11268480834063921,0.0015069041653296338,135.4258854679408,154.66751207845843,164.81377845643496,177.66631669600923,217.62426152910393,282,108.38500000000022

2152,"I'd like to pick up where Justice Kavanaugh left off. I mean, on the one hand, as Justice Kavanaugh points out, it's not very analytically satisfying to rely on the dicta, particularly from the footnote in Strate. But I want to try this on -- you know, you say one problem with our -- you know, or the government's approach or an approach saying that there is some sort of retained authority to police here is that we haven't identified its scope or its source. But, you know, Montana and those cases that followed it relied pretty heavily on the unfairness of imposing tribal law on those who didn't participate in its creation. And in that respect, Strate's footnote is perfectly consistent with that because, as the United States pointed out in argument and in its brief, you know, Cooley and -- and other non-members of the tribe are represented in the creation of federal law. And so it doesn't pose that same problem here. It's -- it's far less of an unfairness, and Strate's footnote can be seen to be consistent with that principle, particularly if the United States is right that one way to understand Montana is that that is an instance of implied preemption that cashes out when you consider the assertion of authority to adjudicate finally civil or criminal liability or the imposition of regulations on those who didn't participate in its exercise.

So some -- some communities are creating a situation where social workers go in. Would that be reasonable? Do you need to have an administrative scheme or an administrative warrant or something like that?

2347,"Counsel, I think that Justice Alito hit the nail on the head, because I've read the decisions of other circuits. They seem all to have different factors that make up community caretaking, and I'm actually not sure what it means. But I am concerned deeply about the First Circuit's claim that there is no requirement that officers must select the least intrusive means of fulfilling care -- community caretaking responsibilities. I think what everyone has forgotten here is that, at least in this situation, there was no immediate danger to the person threatening suicide and no immediate danger to the wife because the suicide person was removed to a hospital. And so the issue is, can the police, notwithstanding that and notwithstanding the ability to ask the wife whether she would consent to giving up the gun and ammunition, that they decided on their own to go in and seize the gun. That appears to me to take away from any of the limiting principles that Justice Alito put forth, yes, some -- some -- whether you call it reasonable suspicion, some -- some suspicion, whatever adjective you put there, there was no immediate danger, there were a readily accessible alternative that was ignored, and you're putting into the hands of law enforcement the ability to use their judgment as opposed to that of the psychiatrists who were treating this man, they certainly could have asked the psychiatrists whether they should remove the guns or not.

That's a seizure, because they had reason to believe that he was threatening suicide.

It -- it is a -- it is a determination about an entire category of cases; that is, all of the cases prosecuted and convicted under the California burglary statute. And it is in that situation where the court asks -- looks to the least of the acts criminalized. It asks what is the least thing that could get somebody convicted of burglary in California. Would that constitute generic burglary? If the answer to that is no, then it flunks under the categorical test. But what's involved here is not categorical at all.

To me, it looks like this is probably a factual question about, a contingent set of questions about, what happened in a particular time and place. We're not interpreting any law, any neutral principle, any generally applicable provision. I don't see how Johnson helps because the burden there was on the government in a criminal case. And so I -- so I'm stuck on a lot of that, and maybe you can unstick me. And the other thing I'm also stuck on, just for what it's worth, is the burden in terms of producing the -- the evidence of a conviction mentioned in subsection (3) is the burdens on proving -- the government has while proving deportability, totally different than subsection (4), which is applications for relief from removal or deportability, which then fall on the immigrant.

So why isn't the simple thing to do, keeping the law uniform, simple, as much as it can be, if we read Taylor?

2402,"Counsel, Justice Breyer asked the question basically as I would, which is I read the regulations, they require the alien to put forth those documents in his or her possession. The legal question is, do those documents show that he's been committed -- he has committed a CIMT? You're asking the opposite question. Do those documents show that he has -- hasn't committed a CAI -- CIMT. But the burden of proof is only by a preponderance of the evidence. And if he's provided all of the documents that exist, and no one's arguing -- I don't think you are, because I think you did a search in this case -- that any more documents exist, and we have amici that show why they don't tend to exist, at least with respect to low-level misdemeanor charges, why the presumption that -- the legal presumption, it wasn't a factual presumption; it was a legal presumption that we made in our prior case law -- why that doesn't get him past the preponderance of the evidence standard?

But let's take an analogy. And I guess -- I guess, first, I mean, let's remember how we decide that factual question. We decide it by looking under Shepard to a set of legal documents. So here's my analogy. Let's say this is a contract case, and the question was, what did I agree to? Now, in one sense, that's as much a factual question as this one is. And yet, because we look to the contract, when we look to the contract to determine what I agreed to, we don't think of it as a factual question anymore.

The only question I'm talking about now is the preliminary one. What were you convicted of? But, because you look to a set of legal documents, it becomes a question of law. And I'll just add to this, Mr. Bond, that is the way every court in America treats it. Every court of appeals in this country uses a de novo standard in ACCA cases in order to review that determination.

2425,"All right. Now, counsel, let me go on to where the Chief started. He said that the FTCA talks about a judgment in an action.

This district court could have ruled the other way, could have said the Bivens claim -- or, I'm sorry, the Bivens claims -- like in Mannings, the Bivens claim is good, but the FTCA claim is not.

And the only way to bring a Bivens claim is just to forego the FTCA claim. And that might make sense, you know, as a policy matter, to turn this statute into such an election-of-remedies provision, but the statute doesn't read like that.

And I'll tell you the reason why I'm asking is it seems to me that 1346(c) gives district courts the jurisdiction to resolve civil actions against the government on the bases that's listed in the statute. And it seems to me that that means that the government is submitting as sovereign to the district court's resolution of those claims either way, whether they win or not, so it's different than, say, in Simmons, where the district court does not have jurisdiction to resolve claims if they involve misconduct in the exercise of a discretionary function.

2486,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Michel. Mr. Keisler's second argument in his brief, which is his lead argument today, the argument that the extension, the word ""extension"" is temporal but does not have to be continuous, just to set up how I'm thinking about this and then get your response, you know, you -- you admit it's not an unambiguous word. I think Congress uses ""extension"" sometimes even when something's lapsed. We have the examples -- COVID and other examples. You make a big deal about ordinary usage, but I'll give you three instances in my life where ordinary usage goes the other way from what you -- what you say. So sometimes one that you're teaching and you have a 5:00 p.m. due date for a paper, you know, after the due date, you will get an e-mail entitled Extension Request, you grant a paper extension afterwards. Or when a -- you use a sports contract example in your brief, but oftentimes, if the contract ends at the end of the season, in the off-season, the player signs a new contract. That will be described by most people as player extends for two more years. Or, if you let your print newspaper subscription lapse for a time and then you start it up again, you'll tell your family member or friend, oh, I extended the paper subscription. So I -- I think ordinary usage also, like congressional usage, in my experience at least doesn't tell us exactly. So how do we break this?

But, if it's the alien's fault that the government is not able to remove the alien during this 90 days -- and I'm looking at the period -- the provision in (a)(1)(C), which says, if the alien fails or refuses to make timely application for travel documents, et cetera, that removal period, as defined in the statute, let's say it might be 200 days. But then I'm looking at (a)(3), which talks about supervision after the 90-day period and says, you know, if the alien does not leave or is not removed within the removal period, defined as 90 days in the statute, it says the alien shall be subject to supervision under the regulations.
