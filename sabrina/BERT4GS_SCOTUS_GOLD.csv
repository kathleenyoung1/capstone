0,18-1447,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,135.90500005,161.165," Mr. Silbert, I want to pick up on that very last thing you said but look at it from a different perspective. What independent role do you think international comity plays, given the fact that you already have whether unchallenged forum non convenience grounds and act of state grounds, what is the independent significance of international comity?
",-1.1487345695495605
1,18-1447,Clarence_Thomas_,226.01999995,244.535," Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, I just and perhaps a somewhat preliminary question and a bit different from the Chief. If we come out if we reverse in the following case, in Germany's, hypothetically, what should we do with your case?
",-1.2039244174957275
2,18-1447,Stephen_G_Breyer_,381.32,421.655," I'd like to to pick up on that last question. One, as the Chief, I think, brought up, how do we know that comity is a separate doctrine rather than, say, a a motivating principle underlying a bunch of other doctrines, like foreign non conveniens and and exhaustion and sovereign immunity and abstention? And if we if it is a separate doctrine, what exactly does it consist of? Do you prefer the Ninth Circuit, which has five factors? I Estreicher and Lee are good international law professors, suggest four factors. And maybe you have some other factors.
",-0.6383832693099976
3,18-1447,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,529.87499995,561.44," Section 1606 on which you rely makes a foreign state ""liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances."" The your friend on the other side says this concerns substantive liability rather than threshold federal common law defenses. Why isn't that a a reading that's more faithful to the statutory text?
",-0.519050657749176
4,18-1447,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,626.835,646.14000005," One other question. If we were to rule, hypothetically, and this is just hypothetical, that in favor of Germany on the jurisdictional issue, wouldn't the plaintiffs in this case still have an argument based on their claim of denaturalization?
",-1.2622698545455933
5,18-1447,Sonia_Sotomayor_,679.57,707.355," Counsel counsel, I I don't understand how if in the following case hypothetically we were to decide there's no jurisdiction, what power would we have, essentially, to give an advisory opinion on this international comity doctrine? I thought no jurisdiction meant just that, that we don't have the power to decide anything?
",-0.32034218311309814
6,18-1447,Sonia_Sotomayor_,723.42,742.685," I thought that counsel, I understand that principle, but this is something different. We have already decided we have no we would have already decided we have no jurisdiction, so having made that decision, how would this become nothing more than an advisory opinion?
",-0.13479958474636078
7,18-1447,Sonia_Sotomayor_,751.91,783.47," one final point. As I read the record below, it appeared that this prudential international comity doctrine was not really the focus of your argument in briefing. It seemed to me that the focus was on the that Respondents have to exhaust their remedy. This what you've raised before us seems like a very different tact.
",0.044385720044374466
8,18-1447,Elena_Kagan_,820.61,853.685," Mr. Silbert, you've referred a couple of times now to the historical basis of the comity doctrine. There's an amicus brief by Professors Dodge and Gardner that takes you on on that and that says that all the various cases that you've cited fall into one of two categories: some are immunity cases and some are forum non conveniens cases, and that there's really no historical basis for this separate international comity. So I think I'd like you to respond to to that brief.
",-0.9968303442001343
9,18-1447,Elena_Kagan_,935.19,968.85," You said you're not we're not going back to the old immunity doctrine, the one that was supposed to have been displaced by the FSIA, because that was executive-driven. But I would think the fact that it was executive-driven would cut the other way. At least the executive knew something about foreign affairs and were politically accountable. And and it seems like much of the unhappiness about that doctrine had to do with the fact that it was a kind of kitchen sink approach and nobody could predict it. And isn't that what you're asking us to replicate?
",1.0850865840911865
10,18-1447,Neil_Gorsuch_,1000.975,1042.835," Counsel, that's exactly where I wanted to to go, which is, you know, prior to the FSIA, we we did have what this Court has described as bedlam in a multifactor balancing test on the convenience of the parties as one thing but also international friction and and a sense about foreign foreign dignity and all that, which, as Justice Kagan pointed out, was channeled through the State Department. And, here, you're asking us to do it directly. And I I I guess I'm still struggling with what's the difference between the regime you'd have us create and the regime that Congress clearly wished to displace because it was producing ""bedlam""?
",0.6542705297470093
11,18-1447,Neil_Gorsuch_,1103.13,1122.975," I agree with that. So so let me what do we do on a separate but related matter, which is normally we assume that when when when Congress dictates that we shall hear certain classes of cases, that we have a duty to hear those certain classes of cases, and we can't decide not to do it just because it would be inconvenient to us.
",-0.08285553008317947
12,18-1447,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1143.315,1170.915," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Silbert. On your point that it's easy for courts to apply this, I hear you giving us something of a bright line, that if it's foreign defendants who injured foreign plaintiffs in a foreign country, then abstain. Is that accurate?
",-0.6754942536354065
13,18-1447,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1287.215,1320.955," Good morning, Mr. Silbert. So you told Justice Sotomayor, when she asked you about the distinction between exhaustion and the comity doctrine that we're talking about this morning, that whether you call it abstention or exhaustion, it means you go to Hungary first, that they're functionally the same thing here or they're very closely related. But, if these plaintiffs had exhausted in Hungary first, I gather from your answer to Justice Kavanaugh that they still could not come here, that the doctrine of international comity that you propose would still be a bar, is that correct?
",-0.7137864828109741
14,18-1447,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1556.54,1590.48," Mr. Snyder, this question will not surprise you. You you emphasize the significance of the international relations context as a reason for international comity, but your client, the United States, has scrupulously avoided taking a position on what the courts should do given the international relations context. This is the perfect time for you to fill that void. Why why hasn't the government told the courts what the foreign relations impact on the United States is?
",-0.024192415177822113
15,18-1447,Stephen_G_Breyer_,1782.275,1838.045," Well, it's the same question. One of the things Congress seemed to be upset about and wanted to pass the FSIA was contradictory information from State. The American strawberry industry wants to sue the country of Xanadu, run by a terrible dictator, but, in Xanadu, our strawberry industry is being sued by some Xanadu nationals, and State wants to help our industry. Now all I have to do is reverse the situation and they'll want to help them in opposite ways. So depending on who is being sued where, you get a different result when you ask State, is it immediately in our interest or not and how is American industry being hurt or helped? Is that something we should take into account in comity?
",0.41807329654693604
16,18-1447,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,1888.365,1921.705," If this doctrine is all about the effect on foreign relations, if I were a district judge and I received a motion asking me to abstain on comity grounds, my first question would be, what does the government of the United States think about the foreign relations impact of this of this lawsuit? So won't you be in the position of having to answer that question every time this doctrine is asserted?
",-0.6933637857437134
17,18-1447,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2011.46,2096.245," Counsel, I understood that the FSIA was passed to remove the pressure on the Department of State to decide whether or not it would grant immunity should be granted or not. I, like my my predecessor colleagues' questions indicate, don't know how that pressure would stop in this situation, but I also don't know why that judgment has all not already been made by Congress, meaning if we accept the argument in Germany that expropriation has to be as an international norm, involve only expropriations of non-nationals and not domestic people and we dismiss that case, or if we rule the other way and we say Congress intended for those suits to be in the United States, that, yes, takings from nationals could have a forum here, I'm not sure how we can substitute the Court could substitute its judgment for Congress.
",0.4062076210975647
18,18-1447,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2131.48,2172.735," Why? So why wouldn't the other doctrines that already exist, like forum non conveniens, take care of virtually any other consideration, would be be addressed? Meaning the issue of foreign relations tension is exactly what the FSIA was intended to the judgment of Congress that in these designated circumstances, those tensions should not lead to immunity. But why should they lead to abstention?
",-0.13094225525856018
19,18-1447,Elena_Kagan_,2229.805,2252.265," I mean, I would think that it's that that's exactly what the State Department would be doing here too. They'd be looking at this particular case, the claims in this case, the alternative forum that Hungary is providing in this case, and they would make a decision. I mean, some might say that what's going on here is that the State Department is expecting the courts to do the difficult and sensitive and some might say dirty work for you.
",0.4525599479675293
20,18-1447,Elena_Kagan_,2278.885,2307.555," Thanks. When I asked Mr. Silbert about the historical basis of this doctrine, he gave me the Belgenland case as his principal case showing that this comity-based doctrine that you're espousing, in fact, has such a basis. In your brief, you call Belgenland an early example of forum non conveniens. So what's your best case, best historical case, for this comity doctrine?
",-1.0061135292053223
21,18-1447,Neil_Gorsuch_,2338.81,2382.61," Mr. Snyder, I guess I'm curious about this: Is is what you're arguing for a broad-based comity abstention doctrine or an exhaustion doctrine? In in response to Justice Kagan, I believe you said that the real confusion for the State Department apparently lies in what remedies would be available in Hungary. That sounds like exhaustion. And Mr. Silbert, in response to Justice Barrett, indicated that after exhausting Hungarian remedies, the plaintiffs would be free to come to the United States subject only to preclusion principles, which have nothing to do with abstention and would apply in domestically normal law. So what what do you say to that? Is is what you're arguing for really just an exhaustion argument?
",-0.3596160411834717
22,18-1447,Neil_Gorsuch_,2420.22,2440.985," Yeah, that that's we do that all the time under the the the rubric of exhaustion, counsel. Okay. Fine. Let's say they have to exhaust. Why, if if if Jewish victims of the Holocaust were deemed non-citizens, stripped of their citizenship at least in Germany, why should they then have to go exhaust remedies elsewhere?
",0.18744055926799774
23,18-1447,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2581.995,2617.275," Counsel, the doctrine that you're proposing of comity sounds like a little bit of this and a little bit of that. It it incorporates some concepts from exhaustion and also sounds like forum non conveniens. It also sounds like it incorporates some of the same considerations of foreign relations and friction with other countries that are addressed by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act itself. So would it subsume the need for some of these other doctrines? Like, what role would forum non conveniens still play if we do adopt the broader comity doctrine that you propose?
",-0.8754028677940369
24,18-1447,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2959.6,3003.075," Counsel, your your position is categorical. In other words, you don't think the international comity applies in any case. And yet it's given the nature of international relations, it's easy to envision cases where it would seem particularly inappropriate for United States courts to get involved in litigation. I don't know if this is one of them or or not. I mean, is there room for any kind of a safety valve under your theory where the the doctrine is while maybe not available in the normal course, is appropriate in particularly sensitive international relations cases?
",0.2401200830936432
25,18-1447,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3205.355,3246.015," Thank you. A group of victims of apartheid sue maybe they're from Botswana they sue the South African government on a claim that fits within this for taking their property, et cetera. South Africa says: You don't understand. We don't have apartheid anymore, and we have a system for dealing with it. It's called the Truth and Reconciliation committee. Please don't mess up what we're trying to do, Judge, in New York. Dismiss the case or use comity. What's supposed to happen on your theory?
",0.8405123353004456
26,18-1447,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3268.04,3289.38," but my question is, fine, you think it don't exist it doesn't exist. So, when the people from Botswana sue on apartheid the South African government and the South African government says please don't do this, you're going to mess up our Truth and Reconciliation, the answer your first choice is to say, too bad, we go ahead with the suit anyway, is that right?
",0.8928702473640442
27,18-1447,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3352.8,3368.655," Hmm. Okay. Then what I'm doing, I'm reading to you, as you know, Professor Estreicher's four considerations that would go into comity. And so it seems to me that your at least your second choice is you agree with some but not others.
",-0.5469415783882141
28,18-1447,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3430.99,3462.89," Counsel, I think you really do have to choose between two alternatives. Your primary argument is never, this doctrine doesn't exist, there are no circumstances in which a case could be dismissed based on comity abstention. And so, if there were a case at some time in the future where going forward would cause cause grave foreign policy problems, your answer has to be that's just too bad.
",1.0699180364608765
29,18-1447,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3477.77,3521.13," Yeah, but there could be cases that don't where that don't fall within any of these doctrines that could have very serious foreign policy implications. I I mean, your argument might be right, but you have to either you have to say yes, even if it means war, even if it means very serious foreign policy problems, we want you to say never. Or you have your fallback argument, which is, well, maybe if the State Department comes in and says please do not go forward with this, it will cause terrible international repercussions. That's a fallback argument, but that argument negates your primary argument that this doctrine never existed and, therefore, it doesn't exist at this time.
",1.3119240999221802
30,18-1447,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3557.885,3591.55999995," Well, you know, there is the do no harm principle. And the only issue that is before us, assuming that that you would prevail on the jurisdictional question, is whether this doctrine should be whether we should hold that this doctrine doesn't exist at all, can never be invoked under any imaginable circumstances. It could be that this is just a very, very narrow doctrine. All we would need to decide is it does exist in some form.
",0.5428411364555359
31,18-1447,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3670.065,3702.52," Counsel, I'd like to follow up a little bit on Justice Alito's question, but my simple question to you is, again, hypothetically, if we were to rule that there is no international expropriation customary international law for expropriation from a national, do you also believe that we should address this comity issue, notwithstanding that we held there was no jurisdiction?
",-0.98052978515625
32,18-1447,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3738.53,3780.245," All right. Then one follow-up question to this. Assume that we find a never answer to be inappropriate, because we have at least two shipping cases, the Carolina and the Infanta, in which the in which 19th-century courts declined jurisdiction, at least, in part, out of concern for commercial relations between the U.S. and a foreign sovereign. So it does suggest some equity principles or or comity principles that have guided courts in the common law. So, if we never say never, how should we write it --
",-0.12038890272378922
33,18-1447,Elena_Kagan_,3835.385,3866.415," Ms. Harrington, on much the same subject, I mean, just think about these cases particularly. The I think it's not yours, but the Hungary case in the Seventh Circuit which involved very similar claims. It had potential damages amounting to 40 percent of Hungary's GDP. So this is a suit that could essentially bankrupt a foreign nation. Now that seems as though it's screaming severe international friction. Why shouldn't we be able to acknowledge something like that?
",0.557287871837616
34,18-1447,Elena_Kagan_,3920.49,3953.76," That was going to be my next question, Ms. Harrington, because the SG tells us that, if we if we don't recognize this kind of abstention, then the government is going to be hampered in its efforts to encourage the establishment of of redress and compensation mechanisms for human rights violations. And in some countries, that has worked to at least some extent. So what's your answer to the Solicitor General's position on that score? And do you really think that we can treat Hungary differently because those efforts have not succeeded as well?
",-0.10649506002664566
35,18-1447,Neil_Gorsuch_,4063.17,4106.39," Good morning, Ms. Harrington. I'd I'd like to address a slightly different point that you've you've alluded to a couple of times. Normally, takings within a country are are subject to domestic takings laws. You've argued in this suit that the Holocaust and human rights forms an exception to that rule, but you've also pressed the point and alluded to it today that, even if that rule were normally to apply, it it wouldn't here because Germany and perhaps Hungary stripped citizenship from its Jewish victims during the Holocaust. That's a very interesting argument, but it's not developed much in this Court, and I'm just curious why and and what what we should do about it?
",0.32946062088012695
36,18-1447,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4132.52,4240.555," Good morning, Ms. Harrington. I think you agree that forum non conveniens survives the FSIA, so I take from that that the FSIA would not displace comity if a comity doctrine exists and existed at the time. And you've made important arguments, as have Professors Dodge and Gardner, that the doctrine doesn't exist. And I understand those, but put those aside for now. If the doctrine does exist, then the question's how to apply it. And I did not view it necessarily, again, assuming it exists, as requiring a case-by-case foreign policy or international friction evaluation. In part for reasons others have expressed, that would not be predictable. It would be hard for courts to do that, it wouldn't necessarily be equitable, given the number of courts who would be involved hearing similarly situated plaintiffs. Rather, I viewed that the doctrine at least as it's been articulating as reflecting a general foreign policy concern, and then the question becomes the particulars of the doctrine. And I had understood the argument to be that, if foreign defendants harm foreign parties in a foreign country and remedies are available in the foreign country, then American courts should usually abstain. So, again, if the doctrine exists, what is the problem with that kind of fairly bright-line principle that would not require a case-by-case evaluation of foreign policy interests?
",0.3505662679672241
37,18-1447,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4352.84,4369.44," But that would lead if that applied the way you just described it, that would lead to a private defendant case and being the Court would abstain. In a country defendant case, the Court would not abstain, which seems unusual.
",-0.05857513099908829
38,18-1447,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4382.36,4420.78," Good morning, Ms. Harrington. I have a question about the nature of this kind of comity doctrine especially as compared to forum non conveniens. So everybody agrees that forum non conveniens doctrine survives the enactment of the FSIA, and I'm wondering, why in your view? Is that because forum non conveniens doctrine is a background principle that's incorporated somehow into the statute itself, or is that because courts retain the power to develop it as a common law doctrine? And if the latter, why wouldn't they retain the power to develop a doctrine of comity like Hungary proposes here?
",-0.702256977558136
39,18-1447,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4498.39,4526.485," And let me ask you a question about the citizenship point. You know, you point out that some of the plaintiffs in the suit below were not Hungarian nationals and others have a claim to their citizenship having been severed by the genocide. Is that a claim that you raised below? As Justice Gorsuch pointed out, it's not one that's developed here, it wasn't part of the QPA. Did you raise that below or develop it all below and, if not, did you have to in order to preserve it?
",-0.4641868472099304
40,20-437,Stephen_G_Breyer_,479.895,534.04," Is there it seems to me something anomalous in this situation. Mr. Smith has been in prison for years, exhausted every possible remedy. He's there because he violated crime X, which later we say that the government had no power substantively to create that crime, and then he can go to habeas under Teague and he gets out. But, here, where it seems like the same situation, the government had no power to make this a crime in this way, and Mr. Jones comes in, we put him in jail. Now is there an anomaly in that? And and I can't quite see how to work it out. I'd like to get your response.
",0.7371178269386292
41,20-437,Sonia_Sotomayor_,779.84,854.13," You answered, Ms. Ross, Justice Thomas by saying that you don't see a constitutional issue here. But I do. You've given me a lot of potential mechanisms in which a in which an alien might be able to get a this order reversed, but I don't know that there's a legal opportunity to do that, meaning it all depends on a whole series of discretion. In Lewis, we found it significant that a convicted felon may challenge the validity of a prior conviction before obtaining a firearm. That's basically your point here, that there is an opportunity to do that, but I'm not clear on this record before us if that's the case. So should we be relying just on your representation, or is this one of the issues that hasn't been adequately addressed below that you, for that reason, you say we should not address Respondent's constitutional arguments?
",0.14360959827899933
42,20-437,Sonia_Sotomayor_,888.235,933.68," the reality is that when this conviction happened, neither this circuit nor any court had yet ruled in his favor. And so to say that whether it's him or someone who did raise this before the agency and had taken it to judicial review and the circuit had said no, are all those people if they can prove that they have no chance to void this administrative order because it was illegally entered, wouldn't they have a separate due process argument? Not a constitutional avoidance argument in but a separate due process argument?
",0.17669636011123657
43,20-437,Elena_Kagan_,986.045,1015.885," Ms. Ross, I'd like to talk about this word ""available"" and give you a hypothetical. Suppose that the immigration judge in this case had told the alien, you know, there there just isn't an administrative procedure that you can take my ruling to, this is it, this is the end of the line. What would happen in that case? Would would would would this provision be satisfied?
",-0.8093629479408264
44,20-437,Elena_Kagan_,1046.78,1061.93," So, if if if I just understood you, you said it gets close to Ross. I mean, does it does it get in Ross? Is that a third the the the the the Ross's third category, would that would that, in fact, be unavailable at that point?
",-1.243269443511963
45,20-437,Elena_Kagan_,1087.33,1112.66," suppose that such a misrepresentation would make it unavailable. But instead now now let me switch to another hypothetical and say that the immigration judge doesn't say you have no place to take this, but instead the immigration judge says, and quite wrongly: Your crime is a crime of violence, and there is no way that you will receive any relief from anybody ever again.
",0.8230584263801575
46,20-437,Elena_Kagan_,1143.895,1173.15," So how is that distinguishable from this case? Because, in this case, there's just as much an error in the first from the IJ. Now it's true that the IJ thought and and, you know, in good faith, obviously, that he was faithfully applying precedent. But that precedent was overturned, and and that meant that even when he was doing what he was doing, the law was was was not on the IJ's side. So how is that any different?
",0.15374109148979187
47,20-437,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1476.86,1531.23999995," there are there are a lot of areas where, you know, the door closes and you lose the right to go back and challenge prior determinations. You know, the felon-in-possession rules, some recidivist prosecutions. And I'm just wondering, the void ab initio, you seem to be arguing that whenever there is some kind of change or clarification in the law, you do go back and reopen everything. Now, as counsel noted in response to Justice Alito's question, there are avenues in in this case, this sort of case, to do that. But your proposition seems to me to be limited to, you know, we now know this was wrong, so we have to go and unscramble the unscramble the eggs.

48,20-437,Stephen_G_Breyer_,1787.57,1859.53000005," How, in your opinion, at the risk of repetition, do you get out of this? The the imagine a statute which is absolutely clear. It says, Mr. Jones, you're about to be deported and you will be under these circumstances. If the judge looks at your state record, he looks at that document, and if it says in that document you were convicted of DUI, and you can attack that conviction if it is entered within the last 10 years, but earlier than that it's sacrosanct. I mean, can't the government deport somebody? All he had to do was look at the record. If it's there, we don't care if it's good, bad, indifferent, or whatever it is, we don't want to go back into it, you're now deportable. Well, that's what they've done here with an exception that favors you. How do we get out of that?

And it must be a very small percentage of those, maybe one, maybe two, maybe three people like your client who fall within the category of later on it was determined it wasn't a crime of violence, like driving under the influence. So does your case affect more than a handful of people?

But she mentioned other ways of you attacking or getting this revoked. I don't see that issue in the briefs before us or in the briefs more adequately spelled out for us to really consider that issue fully. But I think the essence of Lewis and other cases that rely on prior convictions, even if they're void or voidable, is that there is a way that a person can challenge that prior conviction independent of committing the crime that says don't possess a gun. You if you were a convicted felon and if you think the felony is void or voidable, you should go back and get it voided. And Ms. Ross's argument is don't reenter the country until you get your removal order voided. So please answer the first question.

But, as you talked about it today, it it strikes me that you're not talking about any kind of misrepresentation, that you're instead talking about what Ross's second category is, which is that the administrative scheme is so opaque so opaque that it becomes incapable of use.

There are there's a big difference between frivolous and meritorious. It's called uncertainty and possible and who knows. So they'll add, on those grounds, it will get over to the federal court. The federal court will say that it it's not frivolous, but it's wrong, and, therefore, they will appeal on everything.

Don't you think that if I'm trying to figure out what Congress intended that I would look to what was before Congress's understand under in front of Congress in its understanding, number one? Number two, that when it told me that it didn't want appellate review of all issues and that it only wanted appellate review of 1442 and 1443 issues, that our review should be limited to what it wanted?

You know, what are what are we to do with that? Is it are we to say that the ratification doctrine really doesn't have that much force, which, you know, I think it sometimes is overused, just speaking for myself, or how are we to get around that here if from from your perspective of trying to convince us to adopt your position?

69,19-1189,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1115.72,1137.56," let me let me interrupt you there and circle back to the congressional ratification point. You know, as Justice Kavanaugh pointed out, the circuits were against you. They had adopted the opposite position.

Should we factor that in at all into our analysis, that there was some criticism of the rule even though it didn't come from courts?

Is the appellate court required to consider those additional grounds for removal or simply permitted to do so? Not with respect to whether the federal officer ground is is frivolous, but let's say they just look at that first and they determine it wasn't frivolous, but it just happens to be wrong, and, therefore, we don't have to look at the other bases.

Mr. Lucas, the you may be right, may or may not be right, on the statutory reading of this, but there seems there's an odd I can't avoid the odd sense that it seems as though we are smuggling in smuggling into review, appellate review, of other issues that are not necessarily the issues that are front and center like federal officer. Could you somehow help me to eliminate that sense of awkwardness?

73,19-1189,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1569.96,1646.48," Counsel, this case is proof of how long a case could be extended if we permit review of every other argument than that raised initially in the complaint. You know, the focus of the cert petition was on the federal officer question and whether other issues could be resolved. But the sub the the grounds for removal was 442, and that was what was at issue. So I'm not sure I agree with you that there isn't inherent delay, but let me ask you a couple of things. Yamaha was decided in 1996. Congress amended the statute in 2011. In that period gap of 15 years, Wright and Miller had questioned the majority rule but suggested that it needed Congress to change it because it read the limitation the way that Respondents do. So I'm not sure how you get around ratification and that it has to have some meaning, especially when we're talking an exception that could open the floodgates of litigation of appellate litigation in the federal system.

And then the defendant decides that he wants to appeal, but he decides that he doesn't really feel like appealing anymore the 1442 ground, he just wants to focus on the other grounds for removal. He abandons the 1442 ground. Would the court of appeals still have jurisdiction to decide the other removal issues?
",-0.7002235054969788
75,19-1189,Elena_Kagan_,1810.44,1820.2," I guess I don't understand your argument.

76,19-1189,Elena_Kagan_,1852.32,1870.48," I mean, if that's the case, I'm going to ask, like, what sense that that makes? Do you think that that's really the the the the statute that Congress wrote here, which is a statute that talked about 1442 but allows the Court to exercise jurisdiction in a case in which 1442 is long gone?
",-0.9977454543113708
77,19-1189,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1896.48,1963.16," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Lucas. I think this is a close call in this case. You have the text that you assert, your reading of the text in in Yamaha obviously helps you, but there are also problems. One is the inequity between defendants, one of whom tacks on 1442 and therefore gets appellate review, the other of whom doesn't have the ability to tack on 1442 and doesn't get appellate review even though they have the same other attempted federal question ground. So that that's one problem, which makes it seem seem doubtful that Congress really intended this. There's also the gamesmanship problem. And then there's the ratification, which I want to zero in on with you. What exactly would you say about the ratification doctrine? Because, if you just read the Black Letter description of the ratification doctrine and lay it down here, it would seem to apply. So what why doesn't it apply?

And when Justice Kagan asked you if there would be jurisdiction, you kind of hedged a little bit and said maybe that was a an instance in which Bell v. Hood could be used or sanctions could be used. But I don't see why so long as the 1442 or 1443 ground wasn't insubstantial or frivolous. So could you say a little bit more about that?

79,19-1189,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2138.92,2157.32," Well, I'm not sure about that, because if it wasn't if it was a decent argument, but they just decided not to press it on appeal, I'm not sure that's a candidate for sanction or Bell v. Hood even if, as Justice Gorsuch was pointing out, we wanted to continue the life of Bell v. Hood any further. But I don't have any other questions. Thanks, counsel.

I I I see the linguistic argument, which is tough for you, but I see the argument from that's order, and the argument from Yamaha, you have to overcome those. I'm not focusing on those. I want to focus on a problem that occurred to me. It's in every legal system. It's important to have an appeal. It's it's unfair not to give people appeals. But, if you give them appeals in the middle of the case, too often you will really muck up the system, take too long. And so we allow some things to go ahead even though there was no appeal and it might be unfair and wrong because we don't want to muck up the system. That's what I see underlying this statute since 1887. You know? No, no appeal. But now they have an appeal on some things. So you're not going to waste a lot of time; it's in the court of appeals anyway. You'll waste some time if you let them have other things. But the big waste, the big time-consuming thing, is getting the appeal in the first place. Now it's here. So we've undercut the main reason for not giving people an appeal. We've undercut it, not destroyed it. Now, if that's correct policy, then that's on the other side that you're trying to argue. So I want you to see what you think.

That first portion, everybody agreed that's the whole order. It's not like a court can review some of it. And, normally, we the question is what happens to the term ""order"" as it appears in the second clause. And, normally, we we read a statute that uses a single term to employ the same definition throughout. The government charges that that's one defect in your statutory interpretation.

I know the Maryland federal judiciary, similarly, is filled with excellent judges. I asked Mr. Shanmugam why he wanted to be in federal court. He gave me a legal answer. He didn't really go beyond that. You really want to be in state court. Why?

Moving on to a different question, as Justice Gorsuch said, I think, the text in isolation is a problem for you, and that means the text is a problem for you. You also, I think, have a problem with Yamaha. And, you know, it's never good to be on the wrong side of a Justice Ginsburg opinion, but particularly on a jurisdictional issue, and what she wrote for the Court there is, ""As the text of Section 1292(b) indicates, appellate jurisdiction applies to the order certified to the court of appeals and is not tied to the particular question formulated by the district court."" And that language, as you know well, is is similar. What do we do with Yamaha? Justice Gorsuch was touching on this as well, but that sentence in particular seems problematic.

87,19-1189,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3862.8,3919.96," Just looking at our cases, it looks like it's often used, to borrow a phrase in a different context from Justice Kagan, like icing on a cake already frosted when we use the doctrine. You cited Helsinn, and that was that's a good case for you to cite, I I agree, but that that was relying mostly on the fact that our precedent we were sticking with our precedent. And it did mention the reenactment. But Professor Eskridge, in his treatises, has pointed out that the presumed intent justification behind that doctrine is, in his words, ""unusually weak."" And I just wonder how much work it can do here given that it it's really not clear, we don't have any indication, that Congress actually or members actually focused on this and intended in any way to ratify the interpretation. Can you respond to that?

So I want to talk about your ""pursuant to"" argument, in which you say that a case hasn't been removed pursuant to 1442 or 1443 unless it has been correctly removed pursuant to those cases. So, in other words, in this case, because the officer removal ground was flawed, we couldn't say that this case had been removed pursuant to the officer removal ground. Has any court of appeals ever adopted that argument?
",-0.8327030539512634
89,19-1189,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4062.48,4084.12," Well, the court didn't do that here, right? Because, I mean, if you're right, it seems like on appeal, if the Fourth Circuit in this case concluded as it did that the remand order was proper, that it had not been properly removed under the federal officer removal statute, they should have dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, not affirm the remand order, correct?
",-0.24099653959274292
90,19-1189,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4103.24,4120.08," But, counsel, that's inconsistent with your reading of the statute because, if the Court doesn't have jurisdiction unless the case has been properly removed pursuant to, say, the federal officer removal statute, there's no jurisdiction.

And there's another way to get to non-immigrant status, and that is by being a TPS recipient. And your argument seems to me to be that, well, if you're in non-immigrant status as a TPS recipient, you must have been admitted and inspected or treated as such because that's the other way to get to non-immigrant status. And I wonder why they're just not two different routes, and if you come in one route, the TPS route, that doesn't mean that you've checked every box to get in through the other route.

And, therefore, you would say, well, they they should be regarded as having checked that box, when you're determining parole and other situations. But that's not what the statute does here.

Just from the definition, we assume that if you gain a certain status, you assume that, well, for the purposes of gaining that status, you must have been admitted. But we know for a fact that's not the case. So what do we do with that?

95,20-315,Stephen_G_Breyer_,473.86,546.37," Well, I have to admit that the immigration statute is pretty complicated. So what's the is there a simple way of explaining this? I mean, I look at 1255, and it says, if you want to change to to your permanent resident if you want to change your your your to to to be a permanent resident or something like that, you have to have been inspected and admitted, which your clients weren't. And then we look over here at the the temporary protected, and it says, during the period where you're granted temporary status, you do have lawful status as a non-immigrant, it's during that period. It doesn't say anything about that you could apply. But you say, well, the word ""non-immigrant"" automatically means admitted. So we look through some of this, and, for example, the U visa holder, the statute says they can apply if they were admitted or otherwise provided non-immigrant status. Now that seems to say admitted is one thing; non-immigrant status may sometimes include that, may sometimes not. I mean, I so help me.

96,20-315,Stephen_G_Breyer_,599.54,646.53," I see that, but, look: to me, at the moment, it seems to make sense to say either. I mean, you could say: You're here, Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith, you came in absolutely illegally, absolutely wrong that you're here, but you're here. And if you're here, we're not going to ship you back to a place where you're really in danger, okay, while you're in danger. But, once that's over, good-bye. That's a way of looking at it. Or it could have meant, well, we want to keep you here once you're here and you're in a terrible situation. You might have been here for a long time. Some were here for a long time.

Okay, we won't ship you back yet because there's a big war or something in your country. But, when that's over, you're over here. Why isn't that logical?

Well, it didn't in the U visa case because they had both things separately. So there must be some way of becoming a a non-immigrant here lawfully where you were not automatically admitted lawfully. And here it is, right in our statute in front of us and also in the U visa case. Anything else? I mean, is that why is that so far off base? Explain that to me. I'd like to know.

99,20-315,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,739.665,766.175," Well, here's another example along the same lines. Section 1255(m) refers to ""an alien admitted into the United States (or otherwise provided non-immigrant status)."" Why doesn't that mean that Congress contemplated that one could be in a non-immigrant status without having been admitted to the United States?
",-1.1203025579452515
100,20-315,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,821.03,845.205," Would you agree that if Congress did in (f)(4) what you say it did, it went about it in a very roundabout way? It specifically addressed two of the requirements for eligibility for adjustment of status, namely, being in and maintaining lawful status as a non-immigrant, but it didn't say anything about inspection or admission. Why would it do that?
",0.031241457909345627
101,20-315,Sonia_Sotomayor_,967.115,1029.97," One of your other arguments is that Section 1254a(f)(4) provides that TPS recipients should be considered as both being in and maintaining lawful status as a non-immigrant. And you're right that usually we hesitate to interpret a statute in a way that would make any of its provisions inoperative or irrelevant. In the case of ""being in,"" however, the government responds that ""being in"" parallels Section 1255(c)(2) bar on an applicant who is in unlawful immigration status, while the ""maintaining"" parallels the separate bar on an applicant who has failed to maintain continuously a lawful status. Now your reply brief did not comment on the government's argument, because it is a way to understand that there's not a super a superfluous argument. So do would you comment now and explain why the government's wrong?

102,20-315,Elena_Kagan_,1110.525,1124.915," Ms. Saharia, you say in your brief and I think this is critical to your argument all persons with lawful non-immigrant status are, by definition, inspected and admitted. If if that's not true, can you still win this case?
",-0.26833412051200867
103,20-315,Elena_Kagan_,1156.04,1174.67," I mean, but there's nothing in that section, is there, that says that reads that you know, that stands for the broad proposition that you're stating? I mean, the section says the admission to the United States of any alien is a non-immigrant, but why does that suggest that admission is something that all non-immigrants get?
",-0.5537429451942444
104,20-315,Elena_Kagan_,1200.72,1228.07000005," But, I mean, you yourself said 1255(m) suggests something different, and you said, well, we shouldn't we shouldn't look to that because it was passed afterward. But just the fact that 1255(m) could have been written without saying something like, you know, notwithstanding Section 1184, suggests that there's no rule of the kind that you're talking about in the first instance.

And I guess, more broadly, I guess that raises the question for me of we need to be careful about tinkering with the immigration statutes as written, particularly when Congress has so such a primary role here. Congress, as I understand it, passed a recent bill. The House, I should say, passed a recent bill on this issue. It obviously has not passed the Senate yet. But but just kind of big picture, why should we jump in here when Congress is very focused on immigration and when you're relying putting forth a good argument but relying on chains of inferences rather than specific language as I see it at least?

106,20-315,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1411.475,1459.715," Good morning. So I have a question about 1254a(h). So it seems to me that that provision cuts strongly against your position because that provision requires Senate super-majority support to approve any legislation that provides for adjustment to lawful, temporary, or permanent resident alien status for any alien receiving TPS. So, if Congress tied or the Senate, you know, in in the bill that Congress passed, has tied its own hands in that way, it would seem unusual that in the same breath, by using non-immigrant status, Congress intended to delegate to the executive much broader authority to treat TPS those in TPS status as eligible for LPR status based only on the word ""non-immigrant."" Could you address that?
",-0.3226919174194336
107,20-315,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1508.84,1544.91," The government's interpretation does give (f)(4) work to do because, you know, those who were in lawful status before, for example, if they overstayed student visas but then became eligible for TPS status, you know, that overstaying is forgiven if there was a gap, or, similarly, if they got TPS status while in lawful non-immigrant status holding a student visa, you know, (f)(4) still helps and cures those obstacles to becoming an LPR. Could you address that?

Throughout it, you said things like the text doesn't foreclose your position; the Court was not required to accept the Petitioners' reading; the statute does not clearly exclude your reading; Congress did not unambiguously mandate the opponent's position. And, of course, you ended by saying that it would not be entirely unreasonable for the Court to rule in your favor. I I made that last one up, but that's part that's what I was expecting to see. Do you want us to say that your interpretation of the statute is the correct one?

109,20-315,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1841.62,1860.34," Well, did you think that at the cert stage? Because, in your response to the petition for cert and this is a quote ""The court of appeals' reading clearly represents the best one in light of the statutory text, structure, and context."" Is that still the Department's position, that your reading is clearly the best one?

110,20-315,Clarence_Thomas_,1896.19,1917.57," Thank you, Chief Justice Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, as a matter of curiosity, if the Petitioners here were allowed to leave the country for a brief visit abroad and return, would they then be eligible for adjustment of status?
",-1.6308447122573853
111,20-315,Clarence_Thomas_,1938.47,1974.315," So the the argument that Petitioners make that the that inspection is implicit in the status of a as a non-immigrant, it seems to be quite reasonable. I mean, how else would you categorize someone as a non-immigrant under these statutes, other than assuming that they have been inspected or that they have been deemed to be inspected?
",-0.8682698607444763
112,20-315,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2098.48,2159.24," Well, my following on from Justice Thomas, I take it the argument of the Petitioner is simply this: You look through the United States, look everywhere, everywhere, every tunnel, every mountain, every lake, every human being you come across who is not, et cetera, if they are non-immigrants and they are here lawfully, they are here as non-immigrants, they will have been either deemed to be or actually been lawfully admitted. So it goes along with the game. There we are. But I admit there are two exceptions. One is crewmen, where they use both terms, and that could just be overinsurance because they wanted those people admitted, and the other is the U visa. And the U visa, they could have been trying to do uncertainty. Okay? So doesn't that lead are there other examples that I've missed? That's my main question, other examples that I missed.

114,20-315,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2462.39,2558.41499995," Counsel, I'd like to return to Justice Thomas's question about people who have traveled abroad, been given permission, TPS people who have been given permission to travel abroad. The Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 provide that, in the case of an alien who's given TPS, whom the Attorney General authorizes to travel abroad temporary temporarily, and who returns to the U.S. in accordance with such authority, the alien shall be inspected and admitted in the same immigration status that the that the alien had at the time of departure. It says it right there: shall be inspected and admitted. By the plain text, it seems to me that any TPS holder who is granted permission to travel abroad and return would be admitted within the meaning of Section 1255. Yet you're telling me that the agency has said no in 2020. It makes no sense to me, counsel. You yourself argue that there's a difference between being between lawful non-immigrant status and admission and admission, and if that's the case, how do you how can you win on that argument?

117,20-315,Elena_Kagan_,2749.01,2775.005," It does seem, though, Mr. Huston, that these phrases like ""admission as a non-immigrant,"" they arise repeatedly in the immigration statutes, so that, you know, Congress seems to be assuming that non-immigrants are, in fact, admitted and that the the status/admission distinction that you continually press on us is really not a distinction with respect to non-immigrants.

Just in terms of your position here with respect to how, if you were to prevail, the opinion's phrased, I think there are three options, and I just want to explore them with you. One, you you argue that we could just say it's at least reasonable, that your interpretation is at least reasonable and not unambiguously foreclosed. A second option is we could just say that your interpretation is the better one, not the unambiguously better one necessarily but just the better one.

I I want to follow on to the questions that Justice Kavanaugh was asking you about, the three ways that we could write this opinion. And one thing I just want to start by clarifying I think the Chief Justice pressed you a little bit on this is it correct to say then that the government has changed its position from the cert stage to the merits stage about whether the statute is clear or ambiguous?

123,20-334,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,135.515,207.555," Mr. Geyser, this is a matter that's dealt with in the local rules, and perhaps my information is is dated, but it seemed to me that if you practice before the court on a regular basis, you'd know what the rules and the customs were, and, if not, you would ask the clerk and he or she would tell you. And I think what they would tell you is one of two things. First, they'd say: We deal with that problem up here you know, haven't you read Rule 39(a) and if there's a dispute, I'll go ask the writing judge what he or she wants to do, and if there's still going to be a fight, we'll send it down to the district court. Or the clerk is going to tell you: You go down to the district court haven't you read Rule 39(e) and if it there's still a fight down there, they'll bring it up here. But it seems to me that that your rule would sort of standardize all those local practices, which, as far as I can tell, haven't really been a problem, because you say the court of appeals has no no authority over this and it has to go to the district court in the first instance. Is that right?

126,20-334,Clarence_Thomas_,397.12,418.425," The the initial costs didn't seem to be out of line as I think it was under a thousand dollars. This is quite substantial because you're around $2 million. Is this an outlier, and then how often do cases like this come up in the Fifth Circuit?

Which costs? Well, the ones listed in (e). So what the what the circuit would do is it would decide what the costs are. But, if there is a dispute, refer it to the district court. And we would assume that that is the rule unless the circuit says in a particular case or in general that there's a different rule. What's wrong with that?

I don't see why the district court is in a better position than the court of appeals to decide those. Now, as to the supersedeas bond, the the district court had to approve the bond.

So, if you read it against, for example, 1924, 1924 says that before you tax costs, somebody has to figure out whether the item is you know, I'm read I'm I'm I'm using the language here correct and necessarily incurred. So that's the kind of thing where you come in for you say I I I paid a thousand dollars for the transcript, and somebody else said says no, it was $2,000 or something like that.

146,20-334,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1496.29,1551.34," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Geyser. My understanding of this is that the dispute is not really whether the district court has authority with respect to costs. The dispute is what the district court can do. And I guess the question is, looking at the structure, the two-tiered structure of this, with 39(a) and 39(e), why isn't the better reading that the district court can determine the amount of the particular costs listed in 39(e) and disputes over whether a particular amount was correct or not, as Justice Kagan points out, but the district court does not have the authority over whether to award the costs at all or to reallocate the costs from what the appeals court has said? Why isn't that the better reading of the structure?
",-0.4568963050842285
147,20-334,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1570.03,1616.34," Well, the the the appellate court just says costs are taxed against the appellant or costs are taxed against the appellee or, as Justice Alito points out, makes an allocation. And once that's done, the the appeals court judge, at least in my experience, doesn't get back involved. Then it goes to 39(d) for the appeals court costs and 39(e) for the district court costs, but that allocation, whether it's 100 percent or some separate allocation, then defines what the circuit clerk does and then what the district clerk does with the particular costs. And there may be disputes over the amounts, but they can't the district court can't clerk or judge, can't reallocate.
",-0.5032898783683777
148,20-334,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1649.99,1670.44," Well, I just want to maybe say one thing on that. To Justice Alito, I'm not sure you specifically answered his question, when the allocation's done by the court of appeals, how can the district court reallocate, and you said that doesn't really happen a lot. Well, I I did that more than a few times when I was allocating costs on the court of appeals.
",-0.10429283231496811
149,20-334,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1698.17,1718.975," I I I guess the point is, when the court of appeals is doing it, it's really not looking at the amount of the costs. And maybe this is a flaw in the system. It's just looking at who won and who lost, and maybe it's kind of a 70/30 or a 50/50 or 100/0, and just making that allocation, and then the amounts are determined by the circuit clerk and the district clerk.

150,20-334,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1740.71,1761.85," Good morning, Mr. Geyser. I want to go back to some of the questions that Justice Kagan was asking you, specifically about 28 U.S.C. 1924. So, as, you know, she read the text to you and it's kind of my question too, I mean, the district courts have discretion to decide whether the costs are correct and necessarily incurred in the case, is that right?
",-0.9375366568565369
151,20-334,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1762.52,1784.185," So why isn't this just a dispute about how broad the district court's discretion is to decide whether a particular cost, here, the bond amounts, were necessarily incurred? Because, as I gather, you're saying here, well, these weren't necessarily incurred. It wasn't necessary to get something that was this expensive. They could have done something different. Is is that another way to frame this dispute?
",-0.1850290149450302
152,20-334,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1802.26,1814.995," Okay. It is in the Fifth Circuit has are you saying that the Fifth Circuit approach says that there's basically no one, because it falls through the cracks, so no one decides whether, you know, X or Y cost was necessarily incurred?
",-0.6546520590782166
153,20-334,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1830.49,1852.62," Okay. And I want to ask you what you think this equitable discretion entails. I mean, you're focusing a lot on the cost of the bond. But I I took you in your brief to also be saying things about, you know, well, the district court's in a position to know about the litigation strategy or the conduct during litigation or the strength of the arguments. Did I misunderstand that?
",-0.2653670907020569
154,20-334,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1874.325,1896.4," Well, I I mean, don't you think that the court of appeals, which has just resolved the appeal, is in a better position to decide what the strength of the arguments were? I mean, you know, Justice Kavanaugh is right. I mean, as a court of appeals judge, I allocated costs, and, if arguments were close, you know, then maybe I didn't give 100 percent to the the prevailing party. You know, it's not the district court doesn't see the merits of those arguments.
",0.5682073831558228
155,20-334,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1919.14,1932.615," Well well, counsel, let me just ask you one last quick question. I mean, in the Respondents' brief, they say that you negotiated I'm looking at pages 10 to 11 of the brief you negotiated for a higher amount as time went on. So, when you weren't surprised?
",-0.9628239870071411
156,20-334,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2191.98,2208.25," just to stop yeah, stop there, that strikes me as awful tough. They're in their merits brief and they're making all the arguments about why they should win, and then they end with a footnote saying, oh, by the way, if we lose, you know, we think we're going to pay too much on the bond? That that's asking a lot.
",0.8488711714744568
157,20-334,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2229.255,2257.945," Well, but the petition for rehearing is not quite clear what the court is rehearing. I mean, the a decision hasn't been made on that yet. So that also seems an odd an odd spot. And if it's before the court of appeals, the court of appeals doesn't know anything about the matter, whether the bond was was too high or or whatever. All those four items, it seems to me, are within the purview at least of the district court's knowledge.

Your your friend on the other side seems to be saying you have to begin in the district court. And and your position, I understand, is, well, that you can certainly refer it to the district court because they may be better at figuring out what the facts are, but but you you just want to say you don't have to?

159,20-334,Clarence_Thomas_,2392.33,2417.05," The going back to the line of questioning from the Chief Justice, it would seem to me if you if it's not raised on appeal and that you go back to district court with these substantial costs, as they were here, you could have a it seems ripe for sandbagging. So how do you get around that concern?
",-0.7527784109115601
160,20-334,Clarence_Thomas_,2500.64,2532.72," But what you've heard from a number of my colleagues is as sitting as court of appeals judges, they make adjust they made adjustments to costs precisely because or in cases in which the decisions were quite close or, as I think they suggested, that maybe it's 60/40 or 70/30. Where would you make those kinds of adjustments in in your process?
",-1.0284672975540161
161,20-334,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2576.145,2606.26," Thank you. Following on from Justice Thomas, I thought that Mr. Geyser said the reason that you cannot raise this in the court of appeals in this case and similar cases is you don't know how much the winning side is going to ask for until the case is sent back. And when he first sees it is in the district court after the case is sent back, so, obviously, he didn't raise it in the court of appeals. He didn't know how much you were going to ask for. That's my impression.
",0.27371636033058167
162,20-334,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2606.665,2641.98," And and if I'm right about that impression, wouldn't a simple rule be, if I were in the court of appeals writing the rule, I would say we follow the rule here in (a), we tax costs accordingly, taxed, and then part 2 of the rule says, if there is a disagreement about the appropriateness of the amount the amount sought in these categories, the district court will resolve it. And then part (c) of the rule says: And if one of the parties wants a different system, they can ask us. So --
",-0.22230035066604614
163,20-334,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2703.13,2731.315," what he wants to do is say don't give them all the costs they're asking for. Adjust it, or don't do it because this is a special situation. But he can't do that. He doesn't know in, if not this case, other cases. This is the third time, same question. Am I not being clear? He doesn't know what you're going to ask for until you ask for it, and that amount, you you find out what he's going to ask for when you get back.

And and I'll say I agree with the Chief Justice. The idea of raising cost issues in the merits brief is very awkward. It's also a very poor fit for a petition for rehearing. So I think that's what's left is objections to the bill of costs. So walk me through the procedure that you think has to occur, particularly with respect to an issue like this regarding the supersedeas bond.
",0.0670233890414238
165,20-334,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2935.27,2965.32," Yeah. Well, just in really in really simple terms, tell me what's supposed to happen. And this all has to happen under a fairly compressed time schedule because you've got the problem of the issuance of the mandate. So there's an objection to the bill of costs. And what is the court of appeals supposed to do with an issue like the one here with the supersedeas bond? That necessarily is going to have to be sent back to the district court, isn't it, for factual determinations? How could the court of appeals review that issue?
",-0.18731845915317535
166,20-334,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3001.595,3032.465," Counsel, I guess the short answer to Justice Alito and correct me if I'm wrong is that you are basically saying the only practical time to raise this is at the point that a winning party files a bill of costs with the court of appeals, that the losing party has an obligation to raise to the court of appeals any equitable considerations it has to change the allocation of costs. Is that correct?
",-1.068377137184143
167,20-334,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3037.61,3059.62," And I agree. And, here, you knew what the costs the other side I I'm trying to cut to the chase, okay? Here, the other side knew what the costs were, and, if it had any defense to those costs equitable or those relating to it being necessary or unnecessary, it should have raised them to the court of appeals. That's your argument, correct?
",-0.641947865486145
168,20-334,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3061.335,3079.89," Now you are not taking away from the district court your position that, if you had gone to a sister corporation for this bond and paid 10 times the market value, the district court still had the power to say that was unnecessary, correct?
",-0.39755693078041077
169,20-334,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3088.55,3118.69," It it it happens that way. But let's talk about a different scenario, okay, one in which a a person expects the record on appeal to have been, and the transcripts to have been, done at X amount, whatever it is. Okay? But all of a sudden the bill of costs comes in and it's the only time they see that it wasn't done at market rates, that it was done in some weird process. Okay?

170,20-334,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3159.99,3201.96500005," let's assume that a that a person is prepared to pay what they expect to be the normal cost. It turns out, unbeknownst to them, that the costs turned out to be astronomical and they simply can't afford it. Who do they take that equitable argument to, if they were unaware of how astronomical the costs would be, not this case, not your case I'm posing a hypothetical, okay on the record for trans on the record reproduction, how can they get back to the Fifth Circuit --

You know what the costs are. I'm talking about preparing the record or doing something else, and all of a sudden you see something and realize it's past my ability to afford, number one; it will bankrupt me, number two; and, number three, my claims were substantial enough so I shouldn't have to undergo that. If I didn't know, how do I get that corrected?
",0.6800435781478882
172,20-334,Elena_Kagan_,3272.81,3338.615," Mr. Salmons, let's suppose that, on one level of discretion, I agree with you, which is the question about who can change these default rules of 39(a), that only the court of appeals can change the default rules. Only the court of appeals, for example, can say, you know, the appellant doesn't get all its costs; it only gets 80 percent of its costs. But then there seems as though there's a second level of discretion, and this is what you were talking with Justice Alito about. He said, you know, (e), 39(e) says taxable. That suggests some kind of discretion. What is that discretion that's taking place in the district court? And you said the district court is doing two things: the district court is deciding whether the costs were actually incurred, you know, properly documented, where are your receipts, all that, and is making sure that the costs that are being submitted fall within the defined categories. Did I get all that right?
",-0.4461793303489685
173,20-334,Elena_Kagan_,3339.54,3382.06," Okay. So but then, if you turn to 1924, 1924 suggests that the district court really has two functions, and and there is discretion in these functions. One is to decide whether the costs are correct, and the other is to decide whether they've been necessarily incurred. And I take that language to be kind of you're giving us this bill and it's true you paid it, but you didn't have to pay it. There was no reason for you to pay it. And it's just not fair to impose that bill on the other party when it's coming out of nowhere and you didn't need to pay it. Wouldn't you say that the district court has discretion to do something about that?
",0.6039738655090332
174,20-334,Neil_Gorsuch_,3459.79,3537.32," Counsel, let me see if I if I understand, putting it all together with supersedeas bonds. So, first, the district court has to, under Rule 62, make make a ruling approving your bond proposal. And, presumably, there, the other side can make any objections they want as to the inequitable inequitable nature of the bond. That that itself can be part of the appeal too. Then we have the appeal, and they could maybe they don't want to raise it in their in their brief. Often, parties do argue, well, if I lose, then then at least give me this. But but let's say we excuse them from that. Then they have a rehearing petition where they have lost. They could raise it there knowing now that they're potentially on the hook. Then they get the bill of costs. They they could raise it there for the court of appeals, and the court of appeals could either make some judgment then, or, as I understand it, some courts of appeals will refer the matter to the district court expressly delegating their discretion to deal with the problem. And then, in any event, when we get back down to the district court on on taxability, the the court must the district court must find the costs necessary. Is that a fair summary of of your understanding of how the law works here?
",-0.5931478142738342
175,20-334,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3573.315,3602.49," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Salmons. On the overview that Justice Gorsuch just provided, which I I think I agree with, and you used the word ""entitlement,"" that the court of appeals determines the entitlement of each party to a certain percentage of the costs, it might be 100/0 or it might be something you know, 50/50 or what have you. Is that how you see that?
",-0.9034861326217651
176,20-334,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3614.21,3630.99," Okay. So that's kind of the allocation of the pie. How big the pie is, in other words, how much is with how much the costs are, is then determined by the circuit clerk for the 39(d) costs and the district clerk for the 39(e) costs, correct?
",-1.8586716651916504
177,20-334,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3631.98,3650.61," Okay. And I think maybe I'm wrong about this, but I think the concern might be that when the court of appeals is making the allocation, it's not aware of how large the costs might be, and if it knew, it might make a different allocation. I don't know if that's the concern, but, if if that is the concern, what's your response?
",-0.510555624961853
178,20-334,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3689.105,3713.835," And to the extent you want to bring it to the attention of the court of appeals, hey, you should think about the size of the costs here, this just isn't printing costs and the usual kind of costs that are in the thousands, not in the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions, the time to bring that to the court of appeals' attention, you could you can do that in the bill of costs in the objection to the bill of costs or the bill of costs, correct?
",-0.4760005474090576
179,20-334,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3763.665,3832.22," Mr. Salmons, I want to go back to Section 1924 and the district court's authority to determine that costs are correct and necessarily incurred in the case. So the question presented asks in part whether the district court has the discretion to reduce appellate costs. But I'm wondering and, you know, it seems to me like this came up potentially in your interchange with Justice Kagan you said that the supersedeas bond costs were you you treated them as a bit exceptional because they'd already been approved by the district court under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. So I gather that you're not really denying that the district court, through 1924, has some authority to reduce when it reviews the costs for excessive copying, et cetera, but just that in this particular case of the supersedeas bond, that it doesn't have the authority to reduce it because the time for that particular cost has come and gone. So you see what I'm saying, that this is maybe a dispute about supersedeas bonds and not more generally about the district court's authority to take into account whether costs are necessarily incurred? Do I understand that correctly?
",-0.10076556354761124
180,20-334,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3877.31,3892.18," But then you're not disagreeing with me, right? You're just saying that when it comes that the district court may have authority pursuant to 1924 to adjust costs because it judges that they were not necessarily incurred. But you're just saying that supersedeas costs are different --
",0.5982572436332703
181,20-334,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3908.005,3946.445," Okay. And so let let me just we've we've talked about different kinds of equitable considerations that can come into account. One is the challenge that, listen, these costs are just too high because you could have gotten you know, you could have done your copying or gotten the bond rates more cheaply than you did. And then the other kind of concern is the one that Justice Sotomayor was raising, like a party's inability to pay, for example. And you're saying that perhaps the kinds of concerns about a party's ability to pay should be directed to the court of appeals, but equitable considerations that go to the necessity of the cost, you agree, are properly decided in the district court?

You spend an awful lot of time in your brief talking about forfeiture and waiver and estoppel. You haven't mentioned that here.

184,65-orig,Clarence_Thomas_,371.615,423.88500005," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. General, the I'm a little bit confused by your argument because, on page 270 of the appendix to the motion for review, it seems as though the River Master is deciding that, well, Texas was unable to take the amount of water that it would have been able to take under the 1947 conditions, and, as a result of that, the water has to be held. And so it basically said: Well, we will say that this is Texas's water. I don't understand you to agree with that. Could you tell me exactly why this assessment by the River Master is wrong?

185,65-orig,Clarence_Thomas_,502.99,523.09," Well, actually, I understand your argument there. But his point is that the reason that that couldn't happen is because you couldn't take your that the that the Red Bluff Reservoir was in disrepair and could not accept the volumes that were that it could have accepted in 1947.
",0.22063660621643066
186,65-orig,Stephen_G_Breyer_,621.935,725.85999995," Well, I start where Justice Thomas left off. You know, this is very technical stuff here, but, as I understood it, and correct me if I'm wrong, there's some water that belongs to Texas. It hasn't got to Texas yet. And for whatever reason, I thought probably because Texas asked, New Mexico stores it in a reservoir, and then some of that evaporates. So the question is, is Texas given a debit for the amount that had belonged to Texas, the evaporated water, which you can't get because it's in the sky. And the River Master says yes. That seems to make sense. That's why we appoint River Masters, to figure those things out. You say: Oh, no, nothing in the contract allows nothing in the you know, the basic document here, the agreement, the compact, nothing allows that. Well, the SG says: Go read how they did it. They did it according to the report of the Engineering Advisory Committee, and that's how they decided that evaporation question. That seems right. And then he pointed to VI(c), which says, unless there's a more feasible method, you ought to use the report of the Engineering Advisory Committee. And that's what the that's what he used. So I understood this very simply. The water's gone. It evaporated. They go to the Advisory Committee's report. They use that and say the evaporated water is Texas's. And they look at, say, VI(c) and say, well, the River Master has the authority to do that, that's the kind of thing we appoint him for, as well as figuring out what all this means. So what's your response?

So your your answer is that for some period of time New Mexico would at some point in the future, New Mexico would be entitled to refuse to deliver water that you would otherwise be entitled to and and have a need for? Is that right?

188,65-orig,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,890.46500005,921.71," Okay. I find this a very difficult case because it seems to me that everybody, both Texas and New Mexico, and the River Master, proceeded in a very informal manner. Statements and requests were made by a variety of officials and employees on behalf of the states. But, to begin, it wasn't clear to me, who is entitled on both sides to make commitments that are binding on the two states?

190,65-orig,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1042.895,1069.92000005," Counsel, is there an e-mail of any kind or something in writing where Texas at any point is rescinding Commissioner or or the Tate Commissioner Tate's e-mail saying store the water for us? Is there any anything in writing by Texas saying release it and release it faster than you are?
",-1.5752393007278442
191,65-orig,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1089.01,1112.14999995," Counsel, that's the whole point, which is: So why did Mr. Commissioner Tate send that e-mail to Texas asking him to hold the water? Clearly, it seems to me that the assumption of holding the water was that the Bureau would act on behalf of Texas.

192,65-orig,Elena_Kagan_,1254.625,1302.975," General Hawkins, if I could take you back to the procedural aspects of this case, your brief makes it sound as though New Mexico blind-sided you with its motion to account for the evaporation losses. But the way I read the record, really, everyone agreed that the issue would be postponed while the parties negotiated. And then, throughout negotiations, everyone agreed that the River Master was, in the end, going to make a one-time adjustment. So everybody agreed with this process. And then, you know, if you look at the record that way, it's you lost, and all of a sudden you think the process isn't any good because you came out on the short side of the process. But, you know, isn't this a process that you agreed to and went forward with for years?
",0.373318612575531
193,65-orig,Elena_Kagan_,1366.59,1386.91," And when you say that all the e-mails are irrelevant to the determination of the substantive question, I take it that that's because you're saying that the e-mails are only about unappropriated floodwater, is that is that correct? So it's the same kind of argument?
",-0.7268366813659668
194,65-orig,Elena_Kagan_,1403.585,1420.63," Well, the text of the manual is the text of C.5 at least in part, right? So the question is, why isn't why wasn't the River Master right and, again, this is under a clear error standard under C.5 given the text of those e-mails?
",-1.002319574356079
195,65-orig,Neil_Gorsuch_,1505.98,1540.47," Counsel, let me pick up where Justice Kagan left off, first off first of all. You you indicate that in order to trigger C.5 of the manual, which speaks about the allocation of evaporative losses, we need, first, to have something in Article VI or Article XII that might allow that application of the manual. But why can't Article III, which indicates who gets what based on 1947 levels why couldn't the master have reasonably thought that the manual applies in those circumstances too?
",-1.0345019102096558
196,65-orig,Neil_Gorsuch_,1547.55,1563.75000005," what it does what it does say is that Texas gets what it had in 1947. And one way to calculate that might be using the manual and and its particular more specific direction with respect to evaporative losses.
",-0.7394041419029236
197,65-orig,Neil_Gorsuch_,1569.93,1590.175," I understand that I understand that, counsel, but I'm really I'd be grateful if you kind of got at my question rather than going back to VI or XII. Why couldn't the master have thought that, in calculating what Texas had in 1947, evaporative losses needed to be considered and the manual was a reasonable way to do it?
",0.1660887598991394
198,65-orig,Neil_Gorsuch_,1608.51,1635.04999995," Counsel, I got it. Separate question: On the back-and-forth questions about procedure here, you suggest that even if that that we shouldn't consider New Mexico's arguments because it was just too late and the Master acted after the deadline. But it's not clear to me why, even if you're correct about all that, any of that is jurisdictional. Can you address that question?
",-0.6502918601036072
199,65-orig,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1708.695,1772.89500005," Okay. On the federal law point, I think your primary submission seems to be that it's not rooted in the compact, what happened here. But I just want you to respond to the the idea that Article VI(c) of the compact and Article III(a) refer to the inflow/outflow method. Then the amended decree points out that you should look to the manual. And the manual, in turn, talks about factors that may increase or decrease New Mexico's obligation. And C.5 then seems to refer to precisely this kind of situation, where there have been losses attributable to its storage in New Mexico. So which parts of that you may take issue with several parts of that chain of reasoning. Have at it.

200,65-orig,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2203.955,2225.76499995," But I thought, in an original action, that we don't review findings under a clearly erroneous standard because the River Master is not in the position of a district court but is acting in our stead. And and I certainly think there are cases that say that. How do you reconcile that?

201,65-orig,Clarence_Thomas_,2289.61,2331.8," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, the State of Texas argues that if it doesn't basically, if it doesn't cross state line, it can't be counted. And the on page 270 of the Joint Appendix, the the River Master suggests, well, we could it couldn't cross state line because Texas was not prepared to receive it. That's a suggestion. I'm not going to read all of the provisions. How do you react to that? Texas says we could have taken it, and it didn't come across; therefore, it can't be counted.

",-1.558855652809143
203,65-orig,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2483.62,2504.945," I don't counsel, I don't understand that answer. If if Reclamation is holding the water for flood control purposes, then how can the water be stored at Texas's request? It it can't be both, can it? It's either being held for for flood control purposes, or it's being held at Texas's stored at Texas's request?
",0.04636950418353081
204,65-orig,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2568.165,2599.525," Well, all right. Let me move on to a different point then. The the decree provides dates by which certain things have to be done. A final report has to be filed by July 1. Does the River Master have the authority by amending the manual to say, well, I really don't have to file a final report by July 1; I can file some other type of report and then make changes to it retroactively?
",-0.93819260597229
205,65-orig,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2665.91,2708.075," Counsel, I'm a bit confused by what the Special Master did and and, frankly, the fact that you haven't objected, if you were holding the water for Texas, he made you pay or took away from you half of the credits for the evaporation from September through March. First of all, I don't know how you could have been holding that water for Texas in September and October when they didn't ask you to. But, if they asked you to, why aren't you entitled to the full evaporation credits?
",0.8674163818359375
206,65-orig,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2746.28,2774.325," All right. So let me stop you there. What would entitle him to have given you're saying a spirit of cooperation. But, if the water was being held both for your benefit and for Texas's benefit, which is how I read his order, how do what does that mean under the normal terms of the compact? If you couldn't release the water, shouldn't you be paying for the evaporation?
",-0.19320808351039886
207,65-orig,Elena_Kagan_,2847.65,2887.35999995," Mr. Wechsler, when you were talking to Justice Alito, you referred to this the Reclamation e-mail to the states where the Bureau says, we expect to start releasing this water on March 1. And you said it would have been released but for Texas's request. Now how about if if I read the record differently, how about if I read the record as showing that, at that point, what was holding up the release was New Mexico's concern about flooding? Then if that were the case, then you wouldn't have a leg to stand on, would you?
",-0.5599099397659302
208,65-orig,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3029.985,3061.86000005," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Wechsler. First, a contextual issue about the real-world impacts of this dispute. General Hawkins said that ruling for you would threaten the farmers and ranchers of west Texas. And I guess I have two questions off that comment. Do you first, do you acknowledge that? And, second, if you do acknowledge that, would ruling against you or how would ruling against you likewise harm the people of New Mexico? If you could just zero in on the real-world impacts of this dispute?
",-1.0011893510818481
209,65-orig,Clarence_Thomas_,3404.04,3434.565," Briefly. Counsel, the I'm a bit confused as to which approach to take. Texas says that Texas allocation refers to what it should have gotten under the 1947 under 1947 conditions. You seem to suggest that it's what would have crossed state line. Could you give us a basis or give me the best argument for choosing one over the other approach?
",-0.515232503414154
210,65-orig,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3488.34,3526.94," Well, I just want to be sure I got your argument. Is this one argument: Look, look at VI(c)(5) and it says go use the engineering report if you want to measure water which could be measured by the inflow/outflow method. Okay. So now we look at the engineering report and the engineering report says: When a Texas allocation is stored in New Mexico, any of the losses after that, called channel losses, are are are charged up to Texas. Now is that how you're interpreting this or not?
",-0.6624633073806763
211,65-orig,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3552.67,3568.165," All right. All right. Now he said, I think by mostly by Kavanaugh, and and what do you think of what their view is on what I just said, and what apparently you came close close enough, I'm close enough to. I want to give you a chance to answer their argument.
",-0.15756118297576904
212,65-orig,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3710.965,3736.82," and perhaps my my grasp of this case is simplistic, but it does seem to me that the water must either be held for flood control purposes or for some other purpose. And for the period when it was being held by the Bureau of Reclamation for flood control purposes, it cannot have been held at Texas's request, which would have required a contract, which didn't exist.
",0.09662305563688278
213,65-orig,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3793.49,3855.27," Counsel, I know you don't think Article XII applies because you didn't use the water. But I looked at the glossary from the Bureau of Reclamation and it says: Any use which lessens the amount of water available for another use. So, for example, irrigation is a consumptive use because it depletes the available water supply, but it does it through absorption and even evaporation as well. And there you would say it was consumptive use. So if I assuming I disagreed with you, what would that do with respect to our decision-making? Can we use Article XII to explain the River Master's decision even though he didn't apply that provision, or do we have only the power to review the River Master's findings?
",-0.13325706124305725
214,65-orig,Elena_Kagan_,3980.76,4011.51500005," Okay. If I could go back to Justice Alito's questions, when when when you said initially the Bureau thought that there was there was there were flood problems, but then those concerns dissipated and and and and Texas's desire for the Bureau to hang on to the water started driving the Bureau's decision-making, but isn't is that did that have anything to do with with flood control?
",-0.6452000737190247
215,65-orig,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4165.92,4187.26," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Ms. Hansford. Earlier in the argument, the Chief Justice asked a question about the clearly erroneous standard, and I wanted to give you an opportunity to provide any thoughts you had on that. Obviously, it was in the 1988 amended decree, but any further thoughts you have about the appropriateness of that standard.

216,19-783,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,132.975,165.95," Mr. Fisher, in Musacchio versus United States, this is what we said: That statute provides two ways of committing the crime of improperly accessing a protected computer: obtaining access without authorization and obtaining access with authorization but then using that access improperly. You didn't mention that case in your opening brief. The government relied on it. You didn't mention it in your reply brief. I wonder what your your answer to that quote is.
",-0.3034946322441101
217,19-783,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,196.78,210.93," Well, but that's not what it that's not what it says. It says and this seems to me to go to the point at issue here that the second way you can violate it is by obtaining access with authorization but then using that access improperly. Doesn't --

218,19-783,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,255.88,284.55," Just to make sure I have your interpretation correct, if if a if a bank has a policy barring employees from accessing Facebook, and an employee exceeds her authorized access and would be covered if she goes onto Facebook, but it wouldn't be a violation if she used that access to look up customers' Social Security numbers to sell them to a third party, right?

219,19-783,Clarence_Thomas_,317.89,345.355," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Fisher, you gave a brief list a list, a parade of horribles. In CA 11, this has been the rule for a while. Has there been can you give us some actual examples of of that happening, someone getting violating this provision because of accessing Zoom or something like that, or Facebook?
",-0.84391188621521
220,19-783,Clarence_Thomas_,431.61,493.995," So you seem to be making a point that, well, if you don't have the authority to access a certain area, for example, you're you have a level A clearance, but you access information that is at a level B or something, that that that would be certainly would would would exceed authorization. But why can't you have the exact same thing on the other end, that is, that you have authority to access information, but you are limited that authorization is limited as to what you can do with it? For example, you work for a car rental and you have the access to the GPS, but rather than use it to determine the location of a car that may be missing, you use it to follow a spouse, or as in this case, the the use of the information is a problem. So I don't understand why you make the distinction between these two levels or ways that you can have or not have authorization.
",0.1614721417427063
221,19-783,Stephen_G_Breyer_,530.18,558.955," All right. The argument on the legislative history I'm interested in because there was an earlier statute which did say pretty clearly it's a crime to use your access for purposes to which such authorization does not extend. And then that was changed to the present language. But, at that time, the history says they didn't mean to make a substantive change. So what do you respond to that?
",-0.9880803823471069
222,19-783,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,656.23,717.07," Mr. Fisher, in this case, we've received amicus briefs from a number of organizations and individuals who are very concerned about what your interpretation would mean for personal privacy. There are many government employees who are given access to all sorts of highly personal information for use in performing their jobs. But, if they use that for personal purposes to make money, protect or carry out criminal activity, to harass people they don't like, they can do enormous damage. And the same thing for people who work for private entities. Think of the the person in the fraud detection section of a bank who has access to credit card numbers and uses that information to sell for a personal profit. Do you think that none of that was of concern when Congress enacted this statute?
",0.19223187863826752
223,19-783,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,767.96,794.22," Yeah, let me ask you about that, because you rely heavily on former Judge Kozinski's parade of horribles, but, in doing that, you read the provisions of this section very, very broadly. Take take the example of the person who puts who lies about weight on a dating website. How would that be a violation of this statute?
",-0.09487716108560562
224,19-783,Sonia_Sotomayor_,857.77000005,905.255," Counsel, I very much understand the concerns of my colleagues about the amicus briefs of illegal conduct that this would not cover, including the one at issue here, your client, a local police officer not your client, I'm sorry yes, your client a local police officer who paid for information he got from a federal computer system, which for personal reasons.

225,19-783,Sonia_Sotomayor_,980.1,1008.55," Counsel counsel, are counsel, are there targeted changes that could be made to limit the reach of this statute to exactly the fears that I think one of my colleagues expressed of the kind of conduct that we would think of as subjecting someone to punishment?

Just to give you an opportunity, rather than just make a policy argument, try and link it up to something bigger.
",-0.5594436526298523
227,19-783,Neil_Gorsuch_,1294.355,1323.57," And then, on the reverse parade of horribles we've heard from the other side, I guess I'm struggling to imagine how how long that parade would be given the abundance of criminal laws available. So, if this one didn't cover that kind of conduct, but there were troublesome forms of it, like your client's behavior in this case, misusing a police database, I assume there are ample state laws available that criminalize a lot of that conduct. Am I mistaken?

Picking up on Justice Gorsuch's question there at the end and following up on questions from earlier, one of the concerns, I suppose, is government employees or financial company employees or healthcare company employees who have access to very sensitive personal information, then disclose it. And I'd appreciate if you could give us a sense of the federal statutes that you think would cover such such disclosures, if any. I I take your reference to state statutes, but are there any federal statutes that you want to identify that would cover that kind of situation?

229,19-783,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1481.42,1500.36," Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Fisher. The 1984 version of the statute likely would have covered this kind of activity. Why do you think Congress would have narrowed it in 1986 when they were so concerned about this kind of activity? I get your textual point, but I'm just trying to figure out why Congress would have narrowed it in that sense?

No, that's I take your point and I meant to say this kind of activity, right, not this case, but and in a different context, and I take your point about the kind of computers covered.

231,19-783,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1558.54,1570.26," Well, what if we read it let me just challenge the your premise. What if we read it to avoid the concerns to require knowledge of the law, as we do with statutes that use the term ""willfully,"" for example?

232,19-783,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1600.09,1638.485," Good afternoon, Mr. Fisher. We've been focusing on the ""exceeds authorized access"" prong, you know, which is the prong that mattered for Mr. Van Buren. But I want to ask you how that prong relates to the other prong, the ""accesses a computer without authorization"" prohibition. Let's imagine that Van Buren faced a very firm departmental policy that said he could not use the computer itself for any personal purpose, and he gets into the computer and does what he did here and looks up license plates for a personal use. Has he violated the earlier prong, the ""accesses a computer without authorization"" prong?
",-0.0413428470492363
233,19-783,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1663.35,1723.58," Well, let me interrupt you for one second, Mr. Fisher, because I'm actually getting, I think, at a different point, perhaps inartfully. It seems to me that the way that you're reading this statute uses authorization as an on/off switch, you know, either you're authorized to use a computer or you're not; either you're authorized to get into a particular database or get a piece of information or you're not. So, here, Van Buren could get the license plates, and it didn't matter if he was getting them for a reason that he was not supposed to get them for. So it it seems to me that you are looking at authorization in a in a bright gates up or gates down kind of way, whereas the government is looking at scope of authorization as included. So, for example, my baby-sitter might have a key to my car so she can pick up my kids from school, but then she uses the car to go run some personal errands. She's exceeded the scope of her authority. And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, why should we understand entitlement or authorization to be just an on/off switch and not to have a scope component?

He seems to think that even if this is a toss-up or it looks like a toss-up, we should rely on that since this is a criminal statute. What's your response to that?
",-1.1188405752182007
236,19-783,Clarence_Thomas_,2253.25,2291.25," No, that's that's good enough. I'd like I'd like to go to something slightly different. The language in before the '84 amendments seemed to cover this more precisely or expressly. Of course, we have a change in there are fewer words, and it it flows a bit better, but would you work through would you explain your without getting too much in the legislative history, the change in language and why you think it actually expands its coverage as opposed to compressing it, as Mr. Fisher seems to think?

240,19-783,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2553.035,2665.31," Well, I find this a very difficult case to decide based on the briefs that we've received. In response to the concerns about the effect on personal property personal privacy of adopting Mr. Fisher's recommended interpretation, he says don't worry about that because there are other statutes that cover it, but I don't really know what those statutes are in many of those instances. And on your side, with respect to the argument that adopting your interpretation would criminalize all sorts of activity that people regard as largely innocuous, you suggest that there are limiting instructions, but limiting interpretations, but I don't know exactly what they are. And it would really be helpful to see them in writing. So what exactly is authorization? What exactly does it mean to obtain or alter information? What is this statute talking about when it speaks of information in the computer? All information that somebody obtains on the web is in the computer in a sense. I have a feeling that's not what Congress was thinking about when it adopted this. So I don't really know what to do with I don't really understand the potential scope of this statute without having an idea about exactly what all of those terms mean. What what help can you give us on that? Is this something that would be would be helpful to have specific briefing on the meaning of all these terms?

241,19-783,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2766.75,2876.465," Counsel I'm sorry, Mr. Feigin. My problem is that you are giving definitions that narrow the statute that the statute doesn't have. You're asking us to write definitions to narrow what could otherwise be viewed as a very broad statute and dangerously vague. But more importantly to me, you said that there is no ambiguity in this statute, but let me give you an example. Imagine a law that says anyone who drives on Elm Street who is not authorized so to drive shall be punished. The ""so to drive"" to me could mean if you're not authorized to drive on Elm Street. But, under your theory, it could be and might very possibly be read as saying you can't ride on Elm Street if you're driving on it with an illegal purpose, you're speeding, you're breaking the law on curfew, you're texting. It could even cover people who drive on Elm Street on their way to commit a different crime, because they weren't authorized to be on Elm Street for the purpose of committing a crime. So, to me, if all you're relying on is that word ""so,"" I don't get around the ambiguity, especially when the other side points to so many examples in the criminal code where the ""so"" refers to the in the manner that has just been described.

242,19-783,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2912.8,2930.035," Don't you think your Mr. Feigin, doesn't your reading sort of render superfluous the second part of the statute? I think what you're arguing is, if I'm not authorized to go on the computer for this purpose, then we don't need the second half of the statute.
",0.24461056292057037
243,19-783,Elena_Kagan_,3024.77,3055.74," Okay. So then the question is what does ""so"" mean, and picking up on what you were saying to Justice Sotomayor, if I understand Mr. Fisher's argument, he says ""so"" means by accessing a computer. And you just said ""so"" means by using your access. And why is it that we should pick your choice of the prior reference rather than his choice of the prior reference?

244,19-783,Neil_Gorsuch_,3140.695,3195.09," Good morning, Mr. Feigin. I guess I'm I'm curious about a a bigger picture question, and that is this case does seem to be the latest, as as the Petitioner's pointed out, in a rather long line of cases in recent years in which the government has consistently sought to expand federal criminal jurisdiction in pretty significantly contestable ways that this Court has rejected, whether we're talking about Marinello or McDonnell or Yates or Bond. You pick your favorite recent example. And I'm just kind of curious why we're back here again on a a a rather small state crime that that is prosecutable under state law and perhaps under other federal laws to try and address conduct that that would be rather rather rather remarkable, perhaps making a federal criminal of us all.

245,19-783,Neil_Gorsuch_,3208.82,3238.575," But I'm I'm I'm asking a bigger question, and that is there is there's there's this pattern, and I would have thought that the Solicitor General's Office isn't just a rubber stamp for the U.S. Attorney's Offices and that there would be some careful thought given as to whether this is really an appropriate reading of these statutes in light of this Court's holdings over now about 10 years, maybe more, in similar laws.

246,19-783,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3287.72,3344.51," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good afternoon, Mr. Feigin. Let's focus on the text a bit. I'd look at the text and think ""accesses a computer without authorization"" means someone who gets on a computer that they're not allowed to get on. And ""exceeds authorized access and obtains information,"" I would think, means you're allowed onto the computer, but you go into a file that you're not allowed to access and that those two things are what the statute might speak to and that disclosure of information that you obtain or misuse of information you obtain is something distinct. But merely browsing around, obtaining the information, that you're not in a file you're not allowed to look at is what that second prong is getting at. So why is that wrong as a textual matter?
",0.18853197991847992
247,19-783,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3437.13,3473.56," I think you acknowledged to Justice Kagan that you would be in trouble here if the word ""so"" were deleted. And you relied on the surplusage canon, but she pointed out that there is some meaning offered by Petitioner to the word ""so."" But even if it were surplusage, that that canon can only take you so far, and this would be, as Justice Gorsuch said, a fairly substantial expansion of federal criminal liability based on one word that you're saying we have to interpret a particular way because of avoiding surplusage. Can you respond to that quickly?

248,19-783,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3514.855,3548.905," Good afternoon, Mr. Feigin. I want to follow up on Justice Kavanaugh's question. The interpretation that he offered to you of that language, ""accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access,"" is similar to the kind of on/off switch that I was describing to Mr. Fisher since you're either authorized to be there or you're not, and it doesn't really take into account questions of scope. You say that ""so"" is what really makes your argument. So are you saying that there isn't any kind of inherent idea of a scope of authorization simply in the word ""authorize"" itself?
",-0.23513877391815186
249,19-783,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3612.6,3633.49," though, you're attributing an awful lot of specificity to the word ""authorization"" that it doesn't, you know, have. You can have very specific authorization from an employer I mean, even from a professor. What if a professor teaching a class, a small class, very individualized, 12 seminar students, and she says you may use a computer in class to take notes but for no other reason?

I just wanted to make sure I have your response to that.
",-0.4402058720588684
251,20-382,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,188.43,217.165," You articulate this theory of statutory interpretation that centers upon what you call an anchor provision, and I'm I'm not quite sure where that fits in our sort of list of statutory guidelines. I I gather it's not quite a defined term, but it's also not a term of art. What's the best authority that you can point me to where you have the kind of analysis that you're asking us to adopt here?

252,20-382,Clarence_Thomas_,278.24,295.84," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Garre, is there any other instance in which that you can think of where the parties reach a settlement and then they turn around and sue each other over the very same problem?
",-1.436322569847107
253,20-382,Clarence_Thomas_,412.335,431.985," But the contribution you're seeking comes from Clean the Clean Water Act. That's what I'm getting at. That's if if you're saying the statute of limitations shouldn't apply should be contained under CERCLA, then why would you be bringing a claim from the Clean Water Act for contribution under CERCLA?
",-0.5898554921150208
254,20-382,Stephen_G_Breyer_,451.17,481.51," Thank you. If we got to the second question, I think your position is that a settlement requires for the purposes of this Act, it requires that there be an express admission of liability. Why? I mean, people settle cases all the time where where they're not going to admit they were liable, but they might agree to take actions of X, Y, or Z in the future, and they might somebody might without do the same thing here.
",-0.3027975857257843
255,20-382,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,581.055,635.24," I'd like to ask you a question about what you see as the relationship between Section 113(f)(1) and 113(f)(3). So 113(f)(1) provides contribution action to offset CERCLA liability and does so ""during or following any civil action"" under 106 or 107. Then paragraph 2 makes it clear that those who settle their liability won't be subject to a contribution action from the matters addressed in the settlement. And then what does 113(f)(3)(B) add? Aren't judicially approved settlements already covered by the phrase ""following any civil action"" in paragraph 1?
",-1.3324925899505615
256,20-382,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,688.835,727.055," What should we make of the fact that paragraph 3(c), (f)(1)(3)(C), refers to I'm sorry, (f)(3)(C), refers to any contribution action brought under this paragraph and sets its own requirement that such actions ""shall be governed by"" federal law? If Congress meant for all all the details in paragraph 1 to carry through to the other paragraphs, including 3, why would it have needed to include that language?
",-1.123327374458313
257,20-382,Sonia_Sotomayor_,779.51999995,830.39," Mr. Garre, I think it's your second question presented that may have created my colleague, Justice Breyer's confusion, because it was my own. Your question asks whether a settlement that expressly disclaims any liability determination and leaves the settling party exposed to future liability can trigger a contribution claim under CERCLA, Section 113(f)(3)(B). Settlement agreements often can disclaim liability but resolve liability at the same time. Many settlement agreements will say, I don't admit liability, but I will resolve my liability under your claims under the Clean Water Act. That's what happened here, correct?
",-0.22541148960590363
258,20-382,Sonia_Sotomayor_,867.43,906.38," All right. Now, Mr. Garre, consider that, could I have, if that if that settlement had said this agreement resolves qualm Guam's legal obligations under all federal environmental statutes by the way, that was very comparable to most general releases. This settlement resolves all claims arising from, related to, whatever the complaint is, arise known or unknown. That's the typical general release. If it had been a general release like that, would you have any arguments in this case?
",-1.162272572517395
259,20-382,Sonia_Sotomayor_,951.76,963.62," That's your greatest that that's the great inequity here, which is the U.S. retained the right to sue you under the Clean Water Act. So your argument is, we should have the right to sue them, correct, for contributions?
",-0.4941447377204895
260,20-382,Elena_Kagan_,979.485,1030.135," Mr. Garre, I guess I I'm wondering whether your anchoring argument is is is really just an effort to make lemonade out of lemons, and and the reason I say that is because it's usually considered a problem in statutory interpretation when one provision, especially very close to another provision, has very different language. So, you know, (f)(1) says liability under 9607 or 9606. And then (f)(3)(B) does not say that but instead uses a very different formulation, drops the section numbers, and says liability for some or all of a response action. So isn't the kind of obvious argument here that (f)(3)(B) meant something different from (f)(1)?
",-0.21058711409568787
261,20-382,Elena_Kagan_,1123.22,1147.42," Mr. Garre, that that it makes perfect sense to to understand (f)(1) differently from (f)(3)(B) just because CERCLA is a statute that's designed to encourage settlements, and if you take this settlement provision to be broad if (f)(3)(B) is broader, it would suggest that it would encourage more settlements?
",-0.7839227318763733
262,20-382,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1435.435,1479.055," Good afternoon, Mr. Garre. I have a question just about how and I'm sure this comes of my ignorance of CERCLA actions but how this works. So 113(f)(3)(B) refers to response action, you know, which is defined in, you know, 106 and 107, which talks about the ability of you know, the the section that you want to sue the United States under, your ability to recover action cost of an action. So, if there's not been an action, so there's been no judicially determined amount of response costs and there's been no administrative or judicially approved settlement, how does the court go about or or how do the parties go about deciding whether costs undertaken actually were response costs?
",-0.393884539604187
263,20-382,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1517.905,1540.79," Well, I guess what I'm getting at is trying to figure out how CERCLA-specific this term, you know, ""response costs,"" is, I mean, because, as defined in CERCLA, you know, the United States is right, it's pretty broad. It can encompass a lot of different things. So what makes something a response cost to CERCLA as opposed to, you know, just a cost for something that wouldn't be covered by CERCLA? And how do you know --
",-0.4904041886329651
264,20-382,Clarence_Thomas_,1879.25,1908.175," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, I'm I admit to being somewhat confused by this, primarily because of the earlier Clean Water Act settlement. Do you think that you could have a CERCLA recovery for, say, penalties under other environmental provisions?
",-0.45905783772468567
265,20-382,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2007.275,2116.98," Well, the trouble I'm having on your side is I can't get too far using the language of the statute. I mean, sure, you could read it your way, ""response action"" refers to a any action, state or federal, brought under any statute dealing with a response action, which is defined in 23, 24. It could mean that, but it could also mean CERCLA actions, okay? It could mean either. And if I look at the definition of ""response,"" it starts by saying ""for purposes of this subchapter."" Then I look at the definition of ""response"" and it's about 450 to 500 words, including all kinds of things I'm tempted to say anything under the sun, that isn't quite true but all kinds of technical things, perimeter protection using dikes, you know, collection of leachate. How do I know whether a state has a collection of leachate law that has nothing really to do with CERCLA? And I don't know. But there could be a lot of lawyers who don't know. And when they go into any one of what could be thousands of cases that involve some of these 450 or 500 words under some law of a state or other federal law, do they know they have only three years to ask for contribution? I mean, this is a pretty tough reading, and a lot of people just won't know they have only three years. They might think they had seven or something else. So what kind of a boundary is this if we read it your way? I mean, what statutes are involved? Have you looked up all the statutes in the states that might use words like any of the 450 or 500 that are there in the definition? You see the thrust of my question?
",0.11705448478460312
266,20-382,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2172.28,2216.635," Counsel, Guam's argument in very simple terms is basically this: We're a small island, and the only reason and while we may have contributed to part of the problem with this dump, the Navy contributed quite a bit too. But, in any event, all of this the respective liability of Guam and the United States should be adjudicated under CERCLA, where the United States could bear some of the costs. But the United States has cleverly proceeded against us under the Clean Water Act for the purpose of avoiding that. Do you have an answer to that?
",-0.09489268064498901
267,20-382,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2289.82,2322.05," Let me let me come back to the the subsection 2 argument. Doesn't the the way that's worded show that all of these provisions are meant to operate together? Doesn't that substantiate Mr. Garre's anchoring provision argument? Clearly and and you I guess you concede this (f)(2) doesn't refer to liability to the United States for by anybody for anything. It has to do, presumably, with liability under CERCLA 9607(a), right?
",-0.36732494831085205
268,20-382,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2344.255,2365.33," Well, your your argument is that, if subsection 3 didn't refer to response costs, to a response action, it would be read like 2. But, by putting that in, that was a signal that Congress wanted to pick up liability under the Clear Water Act Clean Water Act, right?
",-0.9994590878486633
269,20-382,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2409.08,2495.11," All right. Now, counsel, you know, one could be prompted to bid build a lid for a dump in response to CERCLA or one might do so in response to a nuisance claim in state court. Both would be response actions. Why shouldn't it matter why a person initiates an activity? It it seems to me, just for the reasons Justice Alito just said, the simplest reason, if ""response action"" is CERCLA-specific in terms of all of the activities that can be, why should we build that into a different act, like the Clean Water Act? By the way, I thought that the harm addressed in the Clean Water Act was re-loosing releasing pollutants without a permit. That's a very different harm than what CERCLA looks to, which is releasing hazardous pollutants, with or without a permit, you're still prohibited from doing that. So those aren't those two different harms, and why should one extinguish or create an obligation to claim under another?
",-0.029427960515022278
270,20-382,Elena_Kagan_,2548.26,2569.715," Mr. Suri, I just wanted to make sure I understood your answer to the Chief Justice about the meaning of (f)(2). If I understood you right, you acknowledge that there was a gap in (f)(2), in other words, liability for what. And you said that the way that gap should be filled is to say liability for a response action. Is that right?
",-1.1242727041244507
271,20-382,Elena_Kagan_,2584.91,2598.045," And and and, Mr. Suri, I mean, I I asked Mr. Garre about this, and Mr. Garre says that your litigating position up until now has been the opposite, that (f)(2) was more like (f)(1), that it's CERCLA liability.
",-0.45431602001190186
272,20-382,Elena_Kagan_,2645.63,2658.41," So, when I suggested that to Mr. Garre, Mr. Garre told me I was wrong, that it would discourage settlements if you read it your way because everybody would be completely uncertain about what they were liable for, so then they would never settle.
",0.5234119296073914
273,20-382,Neil_Gorsuch_,2733.24,2801.105," Good morning. I'd like to ask you a question about preemption. As I understand the government's argument, (3)(B), reads (3)(B) as liability for response action to include settlements with states under state law, and then (3)(C), you read any all those settlements now have to be governed by federal law and, just like that, pretty much every state contribution regime is preempted. We have a brief from, I think, about 25, 26 states and territories, including some very different ones, everything from everybody from Massachusetts to Wyoming, saying that that would seriously impair state cleanup efforts to federalize and preempt every every every every settlement, if you can read ""response action"" quite so broadly, and that this is going to wind up impairing cleanup efforts rather than advancing them. What what what do you what what's your thoughts about that?
",-0.42147889733314514
274,20-382,Neil_Gorsuch_,2827.39,2845.77," Oh, no, sure, I I know we have all these savings clauses everywhere. They're all throughout CERCLA, but but, as I understand your reading of of (B) and (C) under (3), you read (B) to be very broad and and (C) to then say they have to be governed by federal law. So maybe you could turn your attention there if you have some answer to that problem.
",-0.11034154146909714
275,20-382,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2909.23,2966.03," I think you said earlier that if Congress wanted to limit 113(f)(3)(B) to CERCLA, it could have said so. And, obviously, as is often the case, you could flip that question around and say if they wanted to if Congress wanted to usher in your position, they could have said so. So, in thinking about that framing of what's more likely here, what do you make of your opposing counsel's suggestion that you're cutting off a right to sue here, that there's a lack of fair notice, trap for the unwary? And I think that picks up also on some of Justice Breyer's questions. In other words, in thinking about how to think about what you're characterizing as silence here, let's just assume for the second that it that it is we should think about that consideration and how to interpret that here?

276,19-309,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,131.585,154.05," Well, Mr. McConnell, I'd like to begin with the standing issue. Our cases, like Gratts and Northeastern Florida, require that a plaintiff injured by being excluded from competing for a position need only establish that he's ready and able to apply for it. Don't you think he's ready and able?

277,19-309,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,177.98,197.12," Well, I don't think that's applicable. The contractor wants to enter into any contract he can to sell his goods. But just because Adams passed up some judgeships doesn't mean he's not interested in in one that will become available or was available when the others were.

280,19-309,Stephen_G_Breyer_,508.925,558.375," All right. Thank you. I I'd like to return to Justice Thomas's first question. As I understand it, the Constitution says, in respect to the Supreme Court, the Superior Court, and a number of other courts not all that you have offices you have some offices that are for the same major political party, but they can't be more than a bare majority. And then it says the remaining members shall be of the other major political party. So why isn't that just the problem that you said was the problem? If if a bare if a majority or an even number are Democrats, the rest must be Republicans, and the Green Party need not apply. It can't.

281,19-309,Stephen_G_Breyer_,602.965,616.51," Well, I agree there might be a reason for it, but how do you get around the fact that the way that it's written and applied is you have to be a Republican or a Democrat? And there are other parties, period.
",-0.01914834789931774
282,19-309,Stephen_G_Breyer_,637.285,673.59," I see your argument. And the other question I have is is it is the case that the the Plaintiff in this case did apply or did say he would apply to become a judge in any court were it not for these requirements. Now why isn't that good enough to give him standing? I I mean, he's if he assume should we have a hearing to decide if he's sincere? Do you think he's insincere in that or what?

284,19-309,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,765.175,780.305," Well, couldn't he say, in the past, I was equivocal about this, but now I've made up my mind, I want to be a judge, and a position will open up on this particular court on this particular date, and I plan to apply for that? Wouldn't that be enough?

So, if we hypothesize a court with nine members, at what point would the breakdown specified in the constitution be inappropriate? If it nine to nothing, presumably, would not be, according to your prior answer, but what about eight to one, seven to two, six to three, five to four?

You used the word ""bipartisan,"" but, in your briefs, you said that this provision, the majority party provision, promotes partisan balancing and the public's perception of an independent judiciary. I just don't understand why the majority party rule promotes either of those two interests and does it in a better way than the bare majority provision at issue in your section in your Number 2 of Article III? There, all that is required of the bare majority is that it be no more than a bare majority. It doesn't have to be. But could you explain to me why it has to be two parties only who can be judges?

They could pick the most I I I don't know if there's such a word the softest Republican, the one most closely aligned with Democratic values or or something of that nature. It just doesn't seem to me that the that the mere membership in a party connotes an acceptance by a governor.

288,19-309,Elena_Kagan_,1107.27,1153.35999995," Good morning, Mr. McConnell. If I could go back to the standing questions that you've been answering. As I understood your answers, you said two things. One was that Mr. Adams never out and out said he was going to apply, and the second was that, in fact, he didn't apply on numerous occasions. So, as to the first I mean, this is his deposition testimony. I think the the Chief Justice referred to this. He said: I would apply for any judicial position that I thought I was qualified for, and I believe I'm qualified for any position that would come up. So isn't he you know, he out and out says he wants a judicial position, isn't he?
",0.011298912577331066
289,19-309,Elena_Kagan_,1164.1,1178.82," just stop you there. Why why does it fall short of a concrete plan? He's basically saying, I'm I want I would apply for any judicial position that would come up. That's what that's what he says. That's a concrete plan: I would apply for any judicial position that would come up.
",0.6903710961341858
290,19-309,Elena_Kagan_,1187.18,1202.85," that's your second argument, Mr. McConnell, but, as to that, I mean, isn't the answer that it would be completely futile to apply? I mean, as long as this constitutional provision is in effect, and he's an Independent, he's not going to get a position --
",0.26103711128234863
291,19-309,Elena_Kagan_,1243.77500005,1275.43," I I I guess it seems a lot to me like the cases where we've said, you know, when somebody challenges an admissions policy, you know, in Gratts, in in Bakke, things like that, we're not going to make you file the application. We're certainly not going to judge what the likelihood of somebody thinking that the application is meritorious is. As long as this policy remains in effect, you can just challenge the policy.

292,19-309,Neil_Gorsuch_,1310.29,1333.67," Thank you. Mr. McConnell, I'd like to return to the question of the historical pedigree of these requirements. I understand your argument that there are a great many bare majority requirements across country and across time. How how about with respect to the major party requirement? What analogues do you have for that?
",-1.3756440877914429
293,19-309,Neil_Gorsuch_,1372.84,1448.805," But let me let me let me let me interrupt you there, and I'm sorry for doing so, but with our limited time. That that that's what I thought the answer would be, and and and that raises for me the following question. That's the reason for the first question. The major party provision prohibits Independents from service, serving as as judges. That that's quite a quite a sweeping rule. And I as I understand you, you've you've indicated that you'd agree that that violates the Equal Protection Clause as applied to elect elect elected positions. But you indicate that it's somehow very different with respect to appointed positions. And I guess I'm not clear why, given the absence of any historically-rooted tradition along these lines with respect to the major party requirement. I understand your argument that it serves as a backstop for the bare majority rule, which does have historical antecedents, plenty of them, but, near as I can tell, none of those has ever included this backstop before. This is a novel thing. And it does does prohibit a great percentage of the population from participating in the process.

294,19-309,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1504.455,1539.91," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. McConnell. Pick up on standing from the comments and questions of the Chief Justice and Justice Kagan, you keep saying he hasn't applied. Of course, he hasn't applied. He's not eligible. And that's the point. He says, once I'm eligible, I will apply. And I took your answer to Justice Kagan then to be, well, he's applying to too many courts. And I I guess I don't understand why, if he says, I'm interested in any of three or four different courts, that defeats his intent to apply for standing purposes.
",0.870635449886322
295,19-309,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1667.83,1688.115," Well, I guess there's a mismatch, arguably, between the State's interest and excluding Independents altogether from being judges, because Independents could certainly wouldn't you agree that Independents could serve the purpose of achieving a balanced nonpartisan or bipartisan judiciary?

296,19-309,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1884.42,1907.1," Counsel, your client said that he would apply was interested in serving as a judge on on any court, and yet there were several opportunities for him to apply to judgeships for which he was qualified and he didn't do it. So why shouldn't we not take his standing assertions as serious?

297,19-309,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1968.755,1986.28," Well, the strongest statement he has is that he would consider and apply for the job. Now, if if I got an application for a clerkship from someone who said she would consider and apply for the job, I really wouldn't know what to make of that.

You don't cite that case at all in your brief, if I'm remembering correctly, and I wondered what your response was to their reliance on it?

299,19-309,Clarence_Thomas_,2069.02999995,2105.165," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Finger, in Lujan, we said that a petitioner's or ""someday"" intentions really were not sufficiently concrete to amount to an injury. This looks and his intentions of someday doing something did not amount to an injury. This looks much like that. And would you tell me how this differs from the problem that we had in Lujan?
",-0.6897939443588257
300,19-309,Clarence_Thomas_,2151.175,2187.15," Normally, I think, when we think of a sanction, it's a penalty of some sort or a criminal sanction. The let me ask you this: If you don't need anything more concrete than his indication that he would have applied, how formal would this have would that have to be, that his intention the announcement of his intention? Could he just say to a couple of friends at a cocktail party, oh, I think I'm I would have applied for this job but for the fact that I'm not a Republican or a Democrat?

301,19-309,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2242.605,2261.93," As I understand it, and correct me if I'm wrong, two of the five courts, he's perfectly eligible and always has been to apply for, because you can be an Independent. That's the family court and the Court of Common Pleas. So we're only thinking about the other three. Now, as to the other three --
",0.037139296531677246
302,19-309,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2264.145,2299.74," Okay. So, as to the other three, what should we do? He in there was a summary judgment motion. He said he wanted to apply to any court. Before he changed his party registration, he could have, since he was a Democrat my clerk counted 16 openings that were on the other three courts he could have applied to. So so here's a person who says any court, he could have applied before to any, he can apply now to two. Should we have a hearing on that as to whether or should we what?

303,19-309,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2396.435,2413.66," No, I know that, but sincerity is not the same thing as having a chance. And he could have had any chance he wanted to, and then there's the argument about the other three. That's that's one of the things I'm not certain about, but whether sincerity is the answer to this. What do you think?
",0.23789510130882263
304,19-309,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2617.75,2643.6," All right. On the merits, in just in just the couple seconds that are left, suppose the governor suppose there's no provision like this one, but a governor says, under no circumstances will I ever appoint to any judgeship a member a person registered as a member of the other party. From the standpoint of somebody who wants to apply for a judgeship, is there any difference between that situation and the situation here?
",-0.5414205193519592
305,19-309,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2661.67,2795.46," Counsel, your last answer troubles me because there are three rights at issue here that I see, at least three. It's your right, your client's right as an Independent to seek judicial appointment, and that right is being limited by this majority party rule. Then there's the governor's right under Elrod and Branti to decide who he wants to appoint to a certain position, and he could maybe not this governor, but another governor might want an Independent or another third-party applicant, but the constitution stops him from doing that. And that's where I think Elrod and Branti would have quite a a lot to say about whether or not your political affiliations have much to do with your decision-making. And and that, I think, would be what we would have to face given Justice Alito's question, a governor who says, I won't appoint somebody from another party under any circumstance. But that's not the case here. The case here involves the State, and it's the State's choice for its own interests balancing partisanship and promoting an independent judiciary who says, I want to prohibit both your client and the State and the governor from acting in a particular way, i.e. from selecting you merely because you're an Independent. And it seems to me that the bare majority rule, that, or prohibition in this case, is more than adequate to take care of those two interests, but the majority party rule doesn't isn't. But you're arguing against both. Can you tell me why you're saying we can't have severance?
",0.7580881118774414
306,19-309,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2817.61,2833.83," Counsel, I don't mean I don't mean to stop you because I'm mostly interested in the second one. Take a look. All you have to do is take out the last proposition, ""the remaining members of such office shall be of the other major political party.""

307,19-309,Elena_Kagan_,2860.01,2880.395," Good morning, Mr. Finger. I just want to make sure I understood your answer to Justice Alito. He said a governor comes in and he says, you know, I'm a Democrat and I'm committed to appointing only Democrats to the bench. They share my judicial philosophy. That's what I'm doing. You think that that would be unconstitutional?
",0.4286611080169678
308,19-309,Elena_Kagan_,2898.53,2944.43," Well, I'm sure that they're making decisions with regards to merit. There are lots of meritorious Democrats. But they're they're just saying, I'm not going to consider Republicans, I'm only going to consider Democrats. Or, alternatively, let's take another hypothetical. Suppose a a a governor comes in and says, I'm going to do I I like this Delaware scheme. We don't have one in my state. But I'm going to do exactly this. I'm going to make sure that there's only a bare majority and make sure that it's evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. A governor couldn't do that either. There's no constitutional provision. There's no law. This is just a governor's view of good judicial appointment-making.
",1.4064265489578247
309,19-309,Elena_Kagan_,2977.675,2992.585," So you you don't think that there's any difference between the two, having a a law from somebody else, whether it's the constitution or the legislature passes it, on the one hand, and just it being a decision of the appointing authority?
",-0.9949737191200256
310,19-309,Elena_Kagan_,3006.42,3030.93," Okay. Let's assume that we do what you ask us to do and and apply strict scrutiny or some form of heightened scrutiny. Why does this fail? I understood your principal argument to be that this was not the least restrictive alternative. So I guess my question is, what what would be a less restrictive alternative?
",-0.3712959885597229
311,19-309,Elena_Kagan_,3043.69,3074.33," Well, I I doesn't that go to something very different? I mean, sure, that code of conduct is very important and it makes sure that judges are ethical, but it doesn't do what this law tries to do, which is to say we want to create balanced courts, we want to do that both for the appearance of justice, that those courts won't look political, and we also want to do it because we think that those courts will make better decisions. They won't go to the extremes. They'll move to the center. There won't be polarization. There'll be compromise.

312,19-309,Neil_Gorsuch_,3100.545,3139.89," Counsel, we've already discussed standing an awful lot, but I just wanted to clear up one small thing that we didn't discuss, and that concerns the bare majority requirement. The Third Circuit held that your client had no standing to contest that because, as an Independent, it doesn't preclude him from taking office in any judicial capacity. I did not see a cross-petition from you on that. I did see one or two stray sentences in your brief suggesting you contest that. I I I'd just like clarity now. Are you expecting us to to rule on that, or do you concede that that issue is not before us?
",0.4639699459075928
313,19-309,Neil_Gorsuch_,3149.95,3231.785," Counsel counsel, thank you. If you agree it's not before us, that's great. That's all I needed to hear. With respect to the merits, on Elrod and Branti, I want you to react to this, the notion that they might be an odd fit here. They've been applied to protect the affiliation rights of what the Court has called low-level employees in the executive branch. And, here, we have and and they've also been there to ensure that patronage doesn't go too far. Here, we have a requirement that doesn't concern the rights of affiliation necessarily and actually mitigates the problem of patronage by ensuring as it has for the last, I guess, 27 years that a a governor has to pick a candidate from the opposite party. So the first of all, they seem kind of an odd fit. And then then there's the overlay of the Tenth Amendment, which grants states considerable power to organize their own governments, so long as they're republican forms of government, and this Court has repeatedly emphasized the importance of that right in Gregory versus Ashcroft. So can you just react to to those thoughts?

314,19-309,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3272.275,3307.51," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Finger. Picking up on a question earlier from Justice Gorsuch, there is a long tradition of governors considering political affiliation when selecting judges. Delaware seems to just make explicit what has been implicit in many states that leave it to the governor. Why, then given that traditional practice matters in First Amendment analysis, why is that different in kind than governors considering political affiliation?
",-0.5543197989463806
315,19-309,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3339.36,3371.26," I'm sorry to interrupt. So the problem is the categorical nature of Delaware's rule. I think I understand that. Mr. McConnell also identifies, I guess, what I would describe as the ""leave well enough alone"" principle, that the results in Delaware have been superb with Judges, you know, Collins Seitz and Bill Allen and Leo Strine and Norm Veasey and leading lights of the judiciary. What's your response to that argument, that it's produced an excellent, widely respected judiciary?
",0.1311499923467636
316,19-292,Clarence_Thomas_,247.365,276.22," Thank you, Chief Justice. Yes. Ms. Corkran, what are there any cases at common law where the touching was there was a differentiation distinction between touching with an in inanimate object or a projectile, as opposed to actual corporal touching or touching laying on as hand of hands, as the Chief Justice mentioned?
",-1.498923420906067
317,19-292,Stephen_G_Breyer_,392.09000005,416.485," Maybe this is just repetitious thank you, good morning but would you repeat or would you state your view on attempted seizures? It says the right of people to be secure against unreasonable seizures and searches shall not be violated. Well, does that include any right to be free of attempted seizures that are unreasonable?
",-0.7914595007896423
318,19-292,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,496.56,526.51," the person seized the the purse snatcher because the person had a grip on the on the purse snatcher for at least a moment. So it's really hard for me to see how your argument squares with the language of the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable seizures, but let me move on very quickly to another point. Do you have any cases that hold that, at common law, shooting someone constituted an arrest?
",-0.3050050139427185
319,19-292,Sonia_Sotomayor_,610.965,659.665," Counsel, picking up on that last point, it is a little odd to say that a police officer who touches you has seized you in the common law, but, if he has a baton in his hand and touches you with the baton, he's done so indirectly, so he hasn't seized you, and, if he takes a gun and shoots the bullet at you, that's not a seizure because it's a projectile. I'm assuming your what your statement was to my two prior colleagues is that the common law didn't draw that kind of distinction because it made no sense, correct?
",0.4324316382408142
320,19-292,Elena_Kagan_,711.13,729.53," Ms. Corkran, there are quite a number of statements in Hodari D. that support your position. But Mr. Standridge says that they're all dicta and that we are not bound to take account of them. I I was just wondering what your response to that was.
",-0.6964874267578125
321,19-292,Neil_Gorsuch_,882.9,911.85," Well, let let's let's explore that. The the common law of arrest, the laying on of hands, near as I can tell, it kind of arose in the Dickensian debt collector process, that if you could get a hand on somebody through the window of the house, that then enabled you to go go in and grab them inside the house. What what what what's what's incorrect about that and why should we, in in defining the word ""seizure,"" rely on debt collection practices defining the term ""arrest"" in England?
",-0.10909134894609451
322,19-292,Neil_Gorsuch_,932.33,942.765," and back then, guns were not unknown at that time, and and it's pretty hard to find a case in which somebody is shot and that's been held to be even an arrest, let alone a seizure, isn't that right?
",0.22355158627033234
323,19-292,Neil_Gorsuch_,947.13,968.215," Okay. Okay. And then going back to the Chief Justice's example, if a huge roadblock were put before an individual and everybody shoots at him, but nobody hits him, but his window's open and he gets scraped going by, I mean, they meant to stop him with the with the roadblock, and he gets scraped, so it's intentionally applied, that's a seizure your under your theory, right?
",0.3628857731819153
324,19-292,Neil_Gorsuch_,977.555,1004.01," But the bullet didn't hit him. There were bazookas going off. There there's all sorts of massive show of force, but he doesn't stop; he keeps going. He's blasting through at 100 miles an hour, and he blasts through and on he goes, bazookas firing anywhere. Still not seized by any of that because that's a show of force, but he gets scraped through the window as he goes by by the roadblock, and that was intentionally applied force, for sure. That's that's a seizure in in your book, even though it --

325,19-292,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1051.43,1078.32," Thank you. And good morning, Ms. Corkran. With respect to Brower, the other side, as you know, relies heavily on the language in that, which says that a Fourth Amendment seizure occurs only when there is a governmental termination of freedom of movement through means intentionally applied. What would you suggest we do with that language?
",-1.1584364175796509
326,19-292,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1103.41,1137.9," And then I think a few of the questions so far have tried to illustrate a potential distinction between how we normally use the word ""seizure"" in ordinary speech and how it's been used historically versus maybe the legal, common law use that you've described. Is that accurate? How how should we deal with that distinction between ordinary usage, and why shouldn't we just follow the ordinary usage of the term ""seizure""?
",-1.2843302488327026
327,19-292,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1301.92999995,1342.73," Counsel, I I wondered if there was some tension between your position and Ms. Corkran's. Several times in your brief, you talk about that that the the touch can be too light to qualify as a seizure. I'm looking at, for example, page 13, where you say, you know, tapping somebody on the shoulder and asking for immigration paperwork would not constitute a seizure and that the contact must be designed to restrain movement. Is there any distinction between your view of that and the and Ms. Corkran's?
",-0.5632763504981995
328,19-292,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1379.775,1392.165," So, if there's a tap on the shoulder and the officer says, you're I don't mean to hold you up, you're free to go, but, you know, I want to talk to you about this, does that qualify as a seizure?
",-0.32567647099494934
329,19-292,Clarence_Thomas_,1456.395,1506.495," But the seizure after the tackling and the submission or the control had was the only seizure there, so I don't know you seem to be using your your definition or at least the explanation in Hodari for what has what constituted a seizure when there was a finding that there was no seizure there as a basis for your argument. Anyway, let me move on to your case law. Can you think of a single case in at common law where there was a touching by an inanimate object, for example, a projectile, that did not result in the submission that was that constituted a seizure?
",-0.5311306118965149
330,19-292,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,1561.84,1596.585," And and that's it. Okay. So this is what really confuses me about your position. At the bottom of page 18 of your brief, you say that ""any damages claimed in a civil suit would be limited to harms traceable to the brief moment of the seizure."" I would have thought that damages in a case like this, if this is a valid claim, would constitute the effects of having been shot, medical expenses, pain and suffering, lost income, and all that sort of thing. Could you explain what you meant by that statement?

331,19-292,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,1635.07,1650.89000005," Well, I still don't understand what that means in concrete terms. Certainly, her her injury is traceable to the to the to having been shot. Is it traceable to the brief moment of the seizure, which is what you say in your brief?
",-0.3330649137496948
332,19-292,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1677.02000005,1696.005," Counsel, you rely, as does your friend, on Hodari D. Both of you believe, I think and if I'm wrong, let me know that the language in Hodari is not dicta. Could you articulate why you think it's not dicta?
",-0.45845693349838257
333,19-292,Elena_Kagan_,1779.83,1810.705," Ms. Taibleson, I wanted to ask you about exactly that question that you just said at the end because your office did take a different view in Hodari D. This this question was was was viewed as important to the resolution of the case there, and the office said and I'm quoting here ""at common law, the concept that someone could be in flight and yet also be seized would have been unfathomable."" So this is not a criticism of a change of position. I just want to understand what accounts for the change of position in this case.

334,19-292,Elena_Kagan_,1860.86,1875.835," And and, Ms. Taibleson, along the lines of one of the Chief Justice's questions, I mean, is there anything that Petitioner's counsel said in her argument or, for that matter, in her brief with which you, the government, disagrees?
",-1.4899901151657104
335,19-292,Neil_Gorsuch_,1901.975,1919.355," Counsel, in terms of clear administrable lines, the Fourth Amendment, as as interpreted by this Court, the seizures of papers require actual control, effects actual control, show of force under Hodari D., actual control. Here alone, this is an anomaly, isn't it?
",-0.4473569691181183
336,19-292,Neil_Gorsuch_,1928,1976.61," If that's the case, I I guess I'm curious what what what authority do you have in terms of the original and ordinary meaning of the word ""seizure"" at the time of the Fourth Amendment that would would countenance that difference? And and and how I guess you're going to tell me that that incorporates arrest doctrine, but how do we know that, and what what authority do we have for that? The founders were well aware of the word ""seizure"" and well aware of the word ""arrest"" and they deliberately did not use ""arrest,"" it seems. Why should we incorporate Dickensian debt collection practices which were enabled by a very liberal view of arrest to allow somebody to reach through a window, grab somebody, why why should we incorporate those practices into the term ""seizure""?

337,19-292,Neil_Gorsuch_,2014.27,2035.29," Okay. If we're going to do if we're going to do the common law of arrest, I I thought I heard you disagree with your friend earlier and that there it's pretty hard to find a case involving a projectile that constitutes an arrest even under the very liberal Dickensian type debt collection practices cases.

338,19-292,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2054.73,2102.43," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Ms. Taibleson. On your brief in Hodari D., the solicitor general's brief said that the historical evidence defined the term ""seizure"" as requiring actual control over the person or thing seized. And the brief said, as a matter of original understanding, one could not be arrested or seized until he was in the physical custody of the seizer and within his control. The Court in Hodari D., as you point out, did not adopt that position, but was the Court wrong about the original understanding? In other words, who's correct about the original understanding, the solicitor general's brief or Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court?

339,19-292,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2354.98,2385.43500005," Okay. Mr. Standridge, I'd like to follow up with some of the questions that Justice Gorsuch asked of of your friend. There are a lot of cases about private citizens, you know, mere touches and and all that, that, nonetheless, are held to constitute an arrest. Is that the same? Is there any reason we shouldn't translate those into police effecting a seizure?
",-0.6593943238258362
340,19-292,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2426.16,2462.17500005," I thought our cases made clear that the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect at least the level of bodily integrity, personal security that was secured at common law. Is is there there and our cases certainly look to common law precedents about arrest, even if by, you know, Dickens or anybody else. And what authority do you have for that distinction?
",-0.2832740247249603
341,19-292,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2526.045,2549.26," What you emphasized the fact that Ms. Torres drove on and and wasn't actually apprehended, I guess, for for a day. But what if she hadn't been able to continue on or what if she was able to drive on only for a couple hundred yards? Would your conclusion be any different?

342,19-292,Clarence_Thomas_,2606.69,2627.73500005," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Standridge, I'd like you to on Hodari D., I'd like you to give us your reasons for why some of that language that seems to dispose of this case in Hodari D. is not is dicta?
",-1.3358676433563232
343,19-292,Clarence_Thomas_,2738.11,2761.39," When I asked Ms. Corkran about the someone being arrested merely by the touching of an inanimate object, I think she referred to, and I don't want to mischaracterize what she said, but I think she referred to the Isabelle of Countess Isabel of Rutland case in 1605. Are you familiar with that case?
",-0.8300880193710327
344,19-292,Clarence_Thomas_,2804.91,2840.19," So you're saying as that the Countess was compelled to actually be taken to the compter and basically the equivalent of jail, so that would be the seizure, I tended to have read it that way too. The are there any cases that you've seen where the mere touch has been applied to someone outside of the criminal context or in in any of the cases that dealt with the criminal context in at common law?
",-0.8776675462722778
345,19-292,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2845.78,2869.855," Good morning. Suppose that a policeman without a warrant wants to search a private person's house, enters in the middle of the night. Before he can do anything, he doesn't look for a single thing, no chance to look for or search for anything, a big dog drives him out. Is that a search?
",-0.2964227795600891
346,19-292,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2887.165,2914.94," So a person a police officer intending to search, breaking into somebody's house, has not committed a search unless he has a chance to look around. And you say something similar here, that that doesn't seem to me to make the right of the people to be secure in their persons or houses from unreasonable searches and seizures, much protection, a whole area, no protection at all.
",0.3090803921222687
347,19-292,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2996.93,3024.20000005," My point is you could read this Fourth Amendment as applying to attempts because the same harm is there, and it's attempted search attempted seizure. But we haven't read it that way. And, therefore, we need a line that's somewhat bigger than the one you propose, and Hodari and the others are an effort to draw that line and it's as good a line as any. All right. Your response.

348,19-292,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3071.28,3095.62500005," Well, picking up on the ordinary notion of seizure, suppose a police officer is attempting to arrest someone, grabs that person's shirt and holds on to the shirt for a couple of seconds. And then the person breaks free, flees, and disappears. Has that person been seized?
",-0.7989146113395691
349,19-292,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3131.96,3155.25," So a a seizure does not require the submission to the law enforcement officer and it doesn't require that a person be permanently taken into custody. It simply requires that the the person who is doing the seizing has control of that person for some period of time; is that your understanding?
",-1.0827032327651978
350,19-292,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3281.285,3385.625," Counsel, there is an element to the Fourth Amendment that all of our cases, including Hodari, recognized by Justice Scalia, who very much was a advocate of the common law and and quite well informed about it generally, that has to do with the Fourth Amendment's protection of bodily integrity. It is why we call putting a needle in someone's arm a seizure that requires either probable cause or exigent circumstances, et cetera. And all of the common law cases that the other side has quoted to talk about not the seizure of the person in stopping their motion but the seizure of the person with respect to the touching of that person because even a touch stops you. It may be for a split second, but it impedes your motion movement and offends your integrity. You want us to add something more to the word ""seizure,"" you say, because common sense says that when a person is held for some imperceptible period of time, a few seconds, more than a few seconds, I don't know what your answer to Justice Alito meant, that that is more of a seizure than putting a bullet in someone. Am I understanding your argument accurately?
",0.030926980078220367
351,19-292,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3405.405,3431.215," Excuse me, counsel, no, you're asking us to reject the clear line drawn by Hodari and say that Justice Scalia was wrong about what the common law showed. That's exactly what you're asking us to do. You're saying it was pure dicta; his entire analytical approach was wrong.
",0.8969895243644714
352,19-292,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3453.495,3480.16999995," Well, let's let's put it the Fourth Amendment doesn't talk about arrest. It talks about seizure. Those are two very well, a a seizure is a form of arrest, whether you stay arrested or not. Just as in your example of the person pulling away and running away, you can still be seized, you can still be arrested, and then run away.
",0.6847839951515198
353,19-292,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3505.455,3524.19," But that was not that's not that idea of control, as opposed to intrusion, laying your hand on someone, that was all the common law talked about, wasn't it? You try to distinguish away those cases, but that's all they reference.
",0.41372957825660706
354,19-292,Elena_Kagan_,3589.33,3606.51," When Hodari D. said, ""to constitute an arrest, however the quintessential seizure of the person under our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence the mere grasp or their application of physical force with lawful authority, whether or not it succeeded in subduing the arrestee, was sufficient,"" that's dicta?
",-0.6341127157211304
355,19-292,Elena_Kagan_,3630.915,3661.72000005," Yes. And I'll I'll stop. But it's not because I couldn't go on. Hodari D. says this, I count, six times, either in its own language or quoting somebody else. And that's kind of amazing, because it's only a seven-page opinion. So this is just like all over the opinion. It's the way that Justice Scalia reached his conclusion as to that case. So how could it be that that is not binding on us?
",0.8589731454849243
356,19-292,Elena_Kagan_,3686.845,3754.64500005," I guess what strikes me is that you're using an an impoverished understanding of what precedent is as opposed to what dicta is. I mean, these are not what we sometimes call stray statements, things that we said without thinking about them, things that we said without sort of realizing the consequences. These these statements have a kind of self-consciousness and a kind of clarity that one, you know, seldom sees in a judicial opinion. And it's clearly the way Justice Scalia thought he was coming to this conclusion. And the conclusion, you're right, it's not a force case, but essentially he's saying: Well, look, you either need force or you need submission. And he's going through the common law to suggest why those those requirements were not met. So I guess I I'll just ask you again, I mean, if anything other than an ultimate holding is not dicta, this is not dicta, isn't it?
",1.138329029083252
357,19-292,Neil_Gorsuch_,3904.61,3918.07," Okay. And as I think you just noted, and I I just want to make sure I understand, you agree not only would there be a battery claim under state law, there could potentially be a Fourteenth Amendment excessive force kind of claim as well?
",-0.5433304905891418
358,19-292,Neil_Gorsuch_,4069.29,4087.5," Is there is there any a a number of lower courts, of course, held that this passage was dicta. Is there anything disrespectful about saying that some portions of a judicial opinion are are essential to its holdings and others may not have been fully considered, especially when there's been no adversarial testing, as there wasn't in Hodari?
",-0.5284561514854431
359,19-292,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4102.405,4133.34999995," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Standridge. With respect to Hodari, I think there are two issues. First, was Justice Scalia right in the discussion? And then second is the precedent question. On the first question of whether he was right, you're arguing, as I understand it, that Justice Scalia and really all nine justices in that case were wrong about the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment. And I'd like you to explain why where you think they made the mistake.
",-0.3186188340187073
360,19-292,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4246.46999995,4283.205," In terms of Hodari D. as as a precedent, picking up, I think, on what Justice Kagan said, I read the case to say there are two ways you could have been seized, one by force with intent to restrain or one by a show of authority, but in the show of authority, you need actual submission. Those are the two avenues that the opinion outlined as I read it. And neither was met in that case, leading, as Justice Thomas said, to the bottom-line holding that there was no seizure there. Is that an incorrect reading?
",-0.2477879822254181
361,19-292,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4288.10499995,4322.52," The other side makes a point, and I think Justice Breyer was getting at this, there's some symmetry with Jones, the GPS case, of placing a GPS on your car, intent to search, touching your body with intent to restrain. Can you respond to that symmetrical argument that the other side makes and whether there would be any, I guess, lack of symmetry with Jones if we were to rule in your favor here?
",-0.39477139711380005
362,20-5904,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,125.23,147.19," Counsel, if we extend the First Step Act into subsection (C), as as you argue we should because you're concerned about the crack cocaine disparity, but wouldn't that also extend to other drugs? Because subsection (C) covers the waterfront; it's not just the crack cocaine provision?
",-0.8103876113891602
363,20-5904,Clarence_Thomas_,303.585,357.44," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, just so that I'm clear, I'm going to just make a brief statement and ask you where I'm wrong. Petitioner was convicted of possessing an unspecified amount of crack with the intent to distribute. And before 2010, the statute the statutory penalty was zero to 20 years for this this offense. After 2010, the statutory penalty is still zero to 20 years. As far as I can see then, the statutory penalty for your for Petitioner here was not modified. Tell me where I'm wrong here.
",-0.09662017971277237
364,20-5904,Stephen_G_Breyer_,484.42,607.61," All right. I we all have the same question, I guess. Mine is the same as Justice Thomas and the Chief Justice, but let me try to put it less accurately than they did in simpler and directly. Look, the the ratio between crack and ordinary cocaine was ridiculous, 100 to 1 or something. So Congress finally got around to modifying that. Fine. And anybody who had been sentenced under the old range, go back and get resentenced. Fine. The problem is, what has this section got to do with it, (C)? Because this section seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with that ratio. It punishes people for 20 years or for 30 years if they commit a felony, for example, of any drug, Schedule I, Schedule II, plus two others, any drug, any of those drugs with intent to distribute it. It had nothing to do with the ratio. And if you look at the guideline, which is Level 34 for a career criminal, section category 6, that has nothing to do with it. That only not only picks up all the people who twice committed that felony, the crack one, and also people who twice committed many forms of robbery and twice committed. So, if you win this case, I don't see what's to prevent any person any person certainly who convicted of any drug felony, career criminal, from going out and asking, Judge, resentence me. Now that's the practical problem I have, as well as the language not really applying. You get me out of this. I'd love to get out of it. I mean, I think they were much too high. I understand that. But I can't get away from this statute. So you convince me, I hope, that I'm wrong.
",1.2150806188583374
365,20-5904,Stephen_G_Breyer_,643.66,680.38," You don't have to I know your argument on the language, and I suspect you're right about that, about how the how the mentality of the judge within his leeway was different. Certainly, it couldn't have been different from a career criminal. He would have had to depart he would have had to depart there. And I don't know if it affected that or not. But, if we read it your way, I don't see how we get out of the fact that it really covers every drug offender who has two or three prior felonies or or not. You know, it's covering everybody. The Chief was right.
",1.2671940326690674
366,20-5904,Stephen_G_Breyer_,700.21,730.955," It doesn't say that. It says an you're reading it to say any statutory provision that covers, you know, the the mandatory minimum part of the crack offense. Sure. This is the statutory provision that covers it. And then it says, if you were sentenced under such a statutory provision, go and ask for a resentencing. And, by the way, an amphetamine or whatever you call it or an ordinary cocaine offense was sentenced under that statute.
",-0.17857816815376282
367,20-5904,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,811.685,828.37," If I asked you what is the statutory penalty for, let's say, bank robbery or wire fraud or any other violation of a criminal statute, what would you tell me and where would you look to find the answer?
",-1.4236721992492676
368,20-5904,Sonia_Sotomayor_,941.935,987.18," Counsel, when I think of this case and the difficulties with your argument, I simplify it in a different way, okay? Pre-Act, if I sold 5.5 grams of coke, I was in subdivision (B), and I had a minimum that was 5 to 40 years. After the Fair Sentencing Act, I had a range of zero to 20 years. And I don't think there's any dispute that after the Fair Sentencing Guidelines, because I was in subcategory (B), I could move to be resentenced, correct?
",-0.3235722780227661
369,20-5904,Sonia_Sotomayor_,988.915,1073.755," However, if I was in subcategory (C) before the Act, if I sold anything less than 5 grams, my sentencing range was zero to 20 years. And after the Fair Sentencing Act, if I sold 20 less than 5 grams, I was still in a sentencing range of zero to 20 years. My sentencing range for anything that was covered before the Fair Sentencing Act or after the Fair Fair Sentencing Act remains the same. That's your adversary's position. And I think what he says is only those people who received a sentence or who sold crack above 5.1 are eligible for reductions because they're the only ones for whom the penalties changed. And you told the Chief your reading was unambiguous, but I don't think so. And if it is ambiguous, why isn't your adversary not your adversary the other side's position simpler and more direct?

370,20-5904,Elena_Kagan_,1134.47500005,1170.29999995," Mr. Adler, you've referred a number of times to this anchoring effects argument, which is to say that in changing the categories, it would lead to different kinds of sentences. And I have no doubt that that's true, but where do you find any concern about that in the statute itself? The statute, when it talks about statutory penalties, that means, like, the penalties that that that are provided in the statute, not the penalties that are actually given by judges because of these anchoring effects.
",-0.4519290328025818
371,20-5904,Elena_Kagan_,1254.86,1295.72," I mean, you make this this point about Congress wouldn't have wanted lower-level offenders not to get the benefit of this statute when it when it gave that benefit to higher-level offenders. But Congress knew that the Commission had already made changes that benefited all these subparagraph (C) offenders, except the ones whose sentences weren't calculated by reference to the drug guidelines at all, you know, except for career criminals. So why is it so clear that Congress would have wanted to benefit the career criminals in subparagraph (C)?
",0.37130704522132874
372,20-5904,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1356.135,1399.2," Okay. And you've talked several times about the goal of Congress here, and I guess one thing that the questions of my colleagues point out is the text doesn't, at least at first glance, seem exactly in line with that goal, which raises the question, why didn't Congress just say everyone who's been sentenced for crack offenses under 841 is eligible for resentencing, something simple like that? And I realize you can ask that kind of question in almost every statutory case, but, here, it seems like that would have been the easy way to do what you've described as Congress's goal. What what do you think was going on there?
",0.23151370882987976
373,20-5904,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1443.31,1463.835," And your in context point, I think, ultimately rests on this idea that sentencing judges will be affected, as you put it, I think, by changing from four-fifths of the mandatory minimum amount to four-twenty-eighths of the mandatory minimum amount. Is that one of the things you're relying on?
",-0.529763400554657
374,20-5904,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1530.315,1545.61," So, Mr. Adler, let me just pick up right there. Is your position essentially then that ""penalty"" is kind of a shorthand that pulls in and Justice Kavanaugh alluded to this everyone who was sentenced under the prior crack cocaine disparity?
",-1.0114727020263672
375,20-5904,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1548.71,1562.35," That seems pretty sweeping. I mean, the word ""penalty"" and Justice Alito was pointing this out that would give ""penalty"" a different meaning here than it has anywhere else in the criminal code. But that's right? You say, in this particular context, that's what it means?

376,20-5904,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1588.565,1614.665," Okay. Let me let me interrupt you there, Mr. Adler, and ask you a different question. So, if someone is resentenced who had been convicted under Section (b)(1)(B) and let's imagine that they had had, you know, 20 grams when they were initially sentenced, and they're resentenced under the new ranges, is it true that they would have to receive a new sentence?

I guess what I'm trying to get at is it seems to me that the thrust of your argument under (C) is this benchmark idea, that it's not necessarily the case that they were entitled to a different range, but it's all about what the judge would look at as benchmarks. And I'm trying to get at, would that be different under sections (a) and (b)?

Prior administrations have done that. Subsequent administrations are going to do that. But I wondered what standard your office applies in deciding when to take that that step.

379,20-5904,Clarence_Thomas_,2039.68,2069.04," Okay. So let me ask you a question. Let's say, for example, that Congress eliminated all charges of possession with intent to distribute but left simple possession available. Would you say that the elimination of possession with intent to distribute, thus forcing more pressure on the possession, the simple possession charge, would you say that that has modified the simple possession charge?

380,20-5904,Clarence_Thomas_,2088.68,2103.13," I'm sorry, I'm out of time, but I just I don't understand the difference. If if simple possession isn't modified in my example, I don't see how (C) is modified because (A) and (B) the change the changes in (A) and (B) put pressure on (C). I just don't see it.

Now let's take Mr. Terry, who was a career offender, I take it. He had several prior convictions for drugs. And we look at (C), and when we look at (C), and this is before the modification, we look at (C), we see that he possessed with intent to distribute. He had prior convictions for the same thing. And, therefore, he falls within the second sentence, 30-year maximum. Then we look to the guidelines. The guidelines say a career offender that's what he was is sentenced at level 34, category 6. Okay? Now he was sentenced at level 34, category 6 with some modifications to get the sentence down. That's a very high level. Now let's imagine Mr. Terry being sentenced exactly the same way after the change. Why would there be a difference? The only difference could be in the propensity of the judge to depart from the guidelines, to depart downward. And I don't see why. This statute punishes people who are career offenders as applied to him, whether it's methamphetamine, whether it's cocaine, or whether it's crack. And why would the sentence be different, the one from the other, in respect to drugs, whether it's one drug or the other? The guideline or guideline in 4B, you know, career offender guideline, is the same for both. So I don't see how, in an ordinary case, anything would change at least as applied to career offenders.

These are cases where the drug quantity is just over the amount needed to invoke the mandatory minimum.

386,20-5904,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2565.78,2594.655," All right. So, with respect to that, there have been some people who if we were to rule against you and Petitioner, who have already been resentenced. What would happen to those people? Would you have to go back and then give them their original sentence? Because there are some circuits who have read it the way you do read it now, these provisions now, correct?
",-0.6017184853553772
387,20-5904,Elena_Kagan_,2646.67,2667.31500005," Mr. Feigin, I'd like to take you back to your conversation with Justice Alito and read to you a sentence from your own brief where you say ""all crack cocaine defendants sentenced under subparagraph (C) post the Fair Sentencing Act are exposed to the same statutory range as before."" So that's correct, right?
",-1.6199880838394165
388,20-5904,Elena_Kagan_,2680.15,2709.43," And and and what you seem to be arguing is that in (A) or (B), you couldn't make that statement because some of the (A) or (B) people, in fact, are now subject to a different sentencing range, but some aren't. And you're saying, well, if if if if those (A) and (B) people who are not subject to a different sentencing range are getting the benefit of this law, why shouldn't the (C) people too? Is that basically what you're arguing?
",0.07767213135957718
389,20-5904,Elena_Kagan_,2714.235,2736.34," about that piece is, isn't that just a function of the categorical approach at work in this statute? The reason why some (A)'s and (B)'s are getting the benefit of it is because the statute works categorically, and there's nothing mysterious about that. But but the (C)'s are out in the cold because nobody nobody's sentence is affected?

390,20-5904,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2809.65,2854.6," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Feigin. How how do we take into account the reality of sentencing as against the statutory language in this case? I think Mr. Adler says and I think this is correct that sentencing judges many sentencing judges will think about this differently when it's four-fifths of the mandatory minimum versus four-twenty-eighths of the mandatory minimum, and that will have an effect on how they exercise that discretion. I think that's true in many cases, but then how do you link that up to the statutory text?
",-0.7962288856506348
391,20-5904,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2932.79,2961.42," Mr. Feigin, I want to be sure that I understand the distinction between your arguments and the Petitioner's arguments at least in the Petitioner's opening brief. So the Petitioner's opening brief cast this scheme as floors and ceilings, kind of suggesting that anything that was below, in the old scheme, 5 grams, which was the limit in (B), was necessarily funneled into (C). And you pointed out that wasn't correct, am I right?
",-0.38666149973869324
392,20-5904,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2988.32,3005.135," Because am I right that one objection you had to that characterization is that those that were sentenced under (C) weren't necessarily those who had less than 5 grams, but it could have been someone who had 200 grams but was just charged under (C) instead?
",-0.49815499782562256
393,20-5904,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3014.265,3034.25," Okay. And then my other question is, did you view the government's prior position you know, when you changed you changed pretty late. It was the day your brief was due. Is do you characterize it as implausible, or is it your position that the statute is ambiguous and that in light of the purposes of the First Step Act and the Fair Sentencing Act that yours is the better interpretation?
",-0.6703929305076599
394,20-5904,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3214.045,3254.57999995," Counsel, I think you know the basic problem in terms of practical effect, as the people are seeing with respect to your interpretation, and that is that defendants under (A) and (B) get a new sentencing and, indeed, their their time their sentence can be reduced to time served. But, under (C), the least culpable offenders, those people can't. Now now I understand if what Congress if you're right about what Congress said, that's what they said, but why would Congress want that want to implement that result?
",0.17182759940624237
395,20-5904,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3274.6,3291.305," I understand that point, but I think it's a little curious to say that Congress did something that really makes no practical sense because they felt sure that the Sentencing Commission was going to deal with it with retroactive guidelines.
",0.7312738299369812
396,20-5904,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3324.17,3340.885," But but there there is a vast number of people that were sentenced under (C) who will not get any result under the First Step Act, but they're relegated to whatever relief they get under the sentencing guidelines, right?
",-0.5277847051620483
397,20-5904,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3347.275,3377.55," What the other side suggests and and maybe I'm mistaking the the point but that there's no spillover, that these changes that we're talking about apply only in the cocaine context, and even though the provisions we're talking about are not limited to cocaine, that the provisions of the First Step Act don't have any broader effect. Is that is that right?
",-0.3175466060638428
398,20-5904,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3394.83500005,3453.355," The problem that a number of people have pointed out is this the anchoring effect, which would result in people whose sentences can't be changed under (C) really being prejudiced. I think it is you don't challenge the basic logic of the fact that if your sentence is zero to 5 and you have 5 grams, many judges are going to give you a sentence near the near the maximum, but if, for the same possession, zero to 5 under the new ranges, you know, the maximum under not the maximum under (C), but the range before you hit (B) is 28, and a judge is going to look at that and say, well, you're pretty close to the bottom of the range, and so you're going to get a smaller sentence. That seems to me to be incontestable as a logical matter and a consequence of your reading.

399,20-5904,Clarence_Thomas_,3544.10499995,3570.77," You were, at one point in your discussion with the Chief Justice, about to make the distinction between the effect of the quantities on sentencing as opposed to the career status of the defendant.

400,20-5904,Clarence_Thomas_,3647.18500005,3681.64," The again, and and you've mentioned that the Petitioner made a point of arguing I think the government did too, and you alluded to it a few minutes ago about the the use of the term ""statutory penalties."" And you, I think, dismissed that a few seconds ago by by saying that they are changing the language to adjectival language. But could you you address his argument as to what that term actually means?
",-0.8960084319114685
401,20-5904,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3693.915,3820.335," Put aside put aside the language for the moment, all right? I want to focus on what the chief judge the Chief Justice said was was incontestable. In my mind, it's totally contestable. Why? And this is where I think we're having trouble. Think of (C). There are two sentences in (C), I mean, linguistic sentences. The first, a long sentence, has to do with people who are not career offenders. The second has to do with career offenders. Think of the first. Was that person, on your reading, prevented from asking for a lower sentence? Now, remember, the AUSA thought these high sentences are ridiculous, so the AUSA brought it under (C) and not (A) and (B) and said we don't know how much drugs there are, but the judge found out in the pre-sentence report and used the table. Can that person challenge his sentence? Yes. Why? Not under this statute, but because the Sentencing Commission reduced his sentence to reflect the change in the First Step Act. So he's free, all those people, to be resentenced. Now what about the second sentence? The second sentence has to do with career offenders. They aren't free to rechallenge because they were not sentenced under the sentencing guidelines having to do with drugs. They were sentenced under the sentencing guideline having to do with career offenders. Those people really, whether it's cocaine, methamphetamine, or some other drug on Table 1 or 2, it doesn't matter. The amounts don't matter once it's a felony. So there's no reason that they should get to ask for resentencing. Now I've just stated something that's in my mind, and I want you to think about it and admit if what I've said is wrong or right or should be modified?
",0.8685970306396484
402,20-5904,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3886.74,3940.62," Counsel, going, in part, to Justice Breyer's question, under subcategory (A) and (B), even offenders who have had mandatory minimums previously and were career offenders, some of them, their guideline ranges were far above the mandatory minimums or far above the career offender guidelines, yet those offenders got the benefit of the retroactivity in the Fair Step Act. They can come in and argue that their sentences should be reduced, even though the original sentence was not controlled by the guidelines or the mandatory minimum or the career offender category, they got a higher sentence. That's correct, isn't it?
",-0.36947619915008545
403,20-5904,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3992.91000005,4022.33," Counsel, there's a bipartisan sponsors of the First Step Act submitted an amicus brief urging us to reject your argument. They say the Act was intended to grant all crack offenders another chance at a reduced sentence. And there are people who were sentenced as career offenders who can be sentenced now to a lower amount if the judge so gave them due consideration. Why should we ignore this bipartisan consensus --
",0.26962167024612427
404,20-5904,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4023.7,4044.87," as to those who fell in the lowest level of crack? The federal defender tells us that the crack amount that this defendant, even though he's a career offender, sold was probably valued at $50. That's not to take away from his criminal history. But why shouldn't we permit him to be resentenced?

",-0.07981301099061966
406,20-5904,Elena_Kagan_,4098.52,4134.56," Mr. Mortara, something I think is is is odd about this whole case and your argument is that the most natural reading of what ""statutory penalties"" means isn't really even on the table, because the most natural reading, you'd be looking for a modification of a provision that actually gave a sentencing range. You know, you'd be looking for a sentencing range that went from 10 to 20 to 5 to 15. And there's nothing of that kind in this statute, you know, to refer to. So isn't this statute kind of incoherent from the get-go?
",0.8276767134666443
407,20-5904,Elena_Kagan_,4168.705,4193.155," So, if I understand that correctly, you're saying there are people who can't be convicted of subparagraph (B) now who could have been before, and you're right, that that's not true of subparagraph (C). But but you could sort of make the opposite argument, that there are people who can be convicted only of subparagraph (C) now who could have been convicted of other crimes before. So why doesn't the argument work both ways?
",0.18589720129966736
408,20-5904,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4299.365,4449.03," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Mortara. Picking up on Justice Kagan's questions, if the statutory text is ambiguous, given the cross-reference, it seems to me that the other side is asking us to look at a few things or maybe there are a few things that could be considered in how to think about this statute, and I just want to get your reaction to these things. And so one is the, you know, relatively small amount. Justice Sotomayor alluded to this. I asked about the cost. Fifty dollars. And assume it's a few hundred dollars, it's still a low amount that we're talking about here, not the kind of situation that I think most most people have in mind when they think about lengthy sentences for for federal sentencing. So that's one. Two is the history of the disparity, the crack powder disparity. This all kind of stems to June 19, 1986, when Len Bias died, and that was a shocking event, particularly in this area, particularly for those of us who you know, I was a year younger than he was, looked up to him, like everyone in this area did, and that was a shocking event in this area and and ultimately in the country at large and prompted Congress, along with other things, but that was really the proximate cause of Congress moving to establish the 100-to-1 ratio, even though that was a powder situation in the Len Bias situation, the 100-to-1 disparity is ushered into the law, and then there are racial disparities, of course, that develop over time, and Congress really has been working now for 35 years hearing about this and working to claw that back. So that that's something we should be thinking about, I think the other side would say. And then the third, which we've touched on, is the reality of sentencing judges and how they really, in practice I take Justice Breyer's point that some of them in some cases are going to think differently about this when they're close to the limit of five versus not close to the 28. So those three things together, to to the extent the statute's ambiguous, low amount, the history, the racial disparities, and the reality of sentencing, and you can take whatever time you want to answer those.

409,20-5904,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4557.045,4608.3," Good morning, Mr. Mortara. So, repeatedly, people have asked you about the impact on this, the benchmarks, whether it makes sense for lower-level offenders in (C) to be excluded, and the interrelationship between the career offender guidelines and and statutory minimums and this statute. Is it your position I mean, you've explained how, for Mr. Terry and some others, their status as career offenders would preclude any change being made to their sentences by virtue of the First Step Act. Is it your position that there's no one who's left out in the cold who was sentenced for a (C) crime, (b)(1)(C) crime, who now can't take advantage is it is it your position that they're all taken care of or not taken care of, but that they're all stuck because of the career offender or recidivism sentencing provisions?
",-0.43765151500701904
410,20-5904,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4652.455,4671.725," So, when you say to make sure that we're understanding the same thing, when I say ""left out in the cold,"" I mean nobody who could have benefited even from the shift in the benchmarks, you know, that we've been discussing, the practical effect on the sentencing judge. Are are you taking that into account, so there's nobody who could have even been resentenced and perhaps taken the advantage of the benchmarks?

411,20-5904,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,4944.47,4954.88," Thank you, Mr. Adler. Mr. Mortara, this Court appointed you to brief and argue this case as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment below. You have ably discharged that responsibility, for which we are grateful. The case is submitted.
",-1.1572219133377075
412,19-1155,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,137.775,158.66," Okay. So then the court of appeals, in conducting the substantial evidence review, should, it seems to me, do that through the lens of that presumption or take that presumption into account in concluding whether the evidence is substantial. Why why isn't that true?
",-0.37585946917533875
413,19-1155,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,185.175,241.91," Well, then you said explicitly or implicitly. If it's implicitly, I think that raises the Chenery objection that your friends on the other side have stressed quite a bit, and I'd like you to talk about it because, you know, there was one stray cite to Chenery in your opening brief, and then you had I would say the bulk of the argument on the other side in both of the briefs or at least a big chunk of it, and it wasn't cited at all in your reply belief. So I'd like to give you a chance to respond to their Chenery argument, which is that you rely on saying there can be an implicit finding, and yet, under Chenery, we'd like to make sure that that's something the agency relied on, and I don't think we can be sure of that if they didn't say anything about it.
",0.4370797872543335
414,19-1155,Clarence_Thomas_,605.695,619.455," Well, it would seem as though, if the crumbs were on his around his mouth, you would think that that wasn't quite credible, so it seems that the existence of the crumbs could be both, go to credibility and to persuasiveness.
",0.6990254521369934
415,19-1155,Stephen_G_Breyer_,653.625,740.08," Well, I I my question here is reflects my concern with the legal mind. The legal mind loves to make distinctions, but sometimes that should be resisted. So we have a simple rule that treats pretty much all agency cases roughly alike sometimes there are exceptions that what a court of appeals does with a factual matter or some matter like this really is look for substantial evidence, end of matter. So, if, in fact, there's a finding he's credible, then you take that finding and you say is there, with that finding, substantial evidence. And if it's the opposite, you say the opposite, is there substantial evidence. And if the judge doesn't say, Congress tells us what to do. Presume that he's telling the truth, but the presumption is rebuttable, so if nobody says anything, you look at it and you simply say, assuming it was rebutted, we assume that the judge found it was rebutted, and is there substantial evidence? Period. With the assumption that it was rebutted. And that could include, there isn't enough evidence to show it was rebutted. That will just be part of the matter. But what we tell the court of appeals is review substantial evidence, follow the statute as I said, end of end of case.
",0.2924073338508606
416,19-1155,Stephen_G_Breyer_,759.21,783.84," Well, it may be common ground on all of the parties, but it isn't common ground with me, because I would be quite worried about introducing into administrative law, with thousands of agency decisions, some kind of distinction between credible and truthful. I haven't seen that in administrative law cases, but even were it there, I would be afraid of getting everybody mixed up.
",1.2138115167617798
417,19-1155,Stephen_G_Breyer_,888.97,904.365," that testimony means I think the light was red. I saw it as red. And some other people could see it as blue. It depends on the issue in the case. Let's start working this through the court of there are millions of issues that can come up with substantial evidence.
",-0.10782954841852188
418,19-1155,Stephen_G_Breyer_,915.32,926.825," So I think we stay to substantial evidence, period, and we get as close to that as we can, reading into it the part well, it may be too long to explain in a question, but I've made I've made my point.
",0.15885554254055023
419,19-1155,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,939.455,1023.76," Well, I think you have an argument. The Ninth Circuit said in both cases, as I read their opinions, that the the BIA must explicitly say that the alien's testimony is not credible or else there is a presumption of credibility. I think that's incorrect as to the BIA as a matter of law. But, beyond that, I will be truthful. I I found the way that you have briefed this case to be extraordinarily baffling. ""Credible"" means capable of being believed, worthy of belief. It doesn't mean that the testimony is accurate. A person it may turn out that it's inaccurate. But this distinction that you are drawing between ""credibility"" and ""persuasiveness"" is I I I think it's extraordinarily confusing and invalid. If at the end of the day you conclude that your son really did eat the cookies, he was not credible, what he said was not worthy of belief. To to say, well, he was worthy of belief, but in the end, I don't believe him, that escapes me. But maybe you can explain it to me.
",1.5811892747879028
420,19-1155,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1204.04,1305.49," Counsel, can I I'm going to stop you there because I don't want you eating up my time, okay? I I am very confused, and if I'm confused, I I think the rest of the world is confused and so are my colleagues to some extent. Evidence can be credible but not adequate to meet a burden. People can say certain things and you can still say, yes, I believe he encountered the police. Yes, I believe they did something to him. But, no, I don't think it rises to the level of persecution. That's a form of a lack of persuasiveness. There are situations in which people can be credible about one aspect of something but not another. This is a perfect case. Dai may have been credible about the persecution of his wife and the fact that they were forced to abort a child but incredible as to why he left China and whether it was based on the fear of persecution or not. That his wife went back, all the things you mentioned could be viewed that way. There are any dozen reasons. Are we responsible for figuring out what the BIA meant? If it doesn't make an adverse credibility finding, which wasn't made here, and it's not clear what the basis of their decision was, aren't simple administrative law principles at play, and shouldn't we just remand to say what is it that you found incredible?
",1.4253277778625488
421,19-1155,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1361.68,1396.42," Counsel, before you go on with Alcaraz, there, the BIA did remand, and the issue was whether or not the and the and the Ninth Circuit found that they couldn't rely on the probation report, presumably, because the BIA will have to decide whether or not that witness was available for cross-examination or not. But I'm not sure why we granted cert in Alcaraz because the Ninth Circuit did what you're asking, it remanded there.
",-0.44251734018325806
422,19-1155,Elena_Kagan_,1442.03,1509.18," Ms. Sinzdak, you said that the Board had not relied on credibility reasoning in these cases. That's that's your principal submission. And you said instead there were these three pieces of evidence in Dai, there was the probation report on Alcaraz. But, as you listed those pieces of evidence, they all seemed to me to go to credibility. So let's just take the Dai case, and one of the pieces of evidence that you cited was, you know, he started stammering when he talked about his wife's return and he was very hesitant to tell the truth and he looked uncomfortable and that that is classic demeanor evidence going to somebody's credibility. And similarly, the other pieces of evidence, I mean, they all go to whether or not he's telling the truth, which, you know, honestly, join me up to Justice Alito, that that if the evidence is related to whether he's being honest in his testimony, then it goes to credibility. So how are all of those pieces of evidence not essentially related to credibility?
",0.28635355830192566
423,19-1155,Elena_Kagan_,1588.76,1616.875," the the question in the Dai case is all about whether he got beat up because of his opposition to the, you know, so-called family planning policies of China, and, if he did get beat up for that reason, then he has a well-founded fear of persecution under the regulations. And are you saying that the Board said that he was mistaken as to whether he got beat up?
",-0.40571630001068115
424,19-1155,Elena_Kagan_,1646.04,1681.035," Well, then that suggests that his other testimony was a lie, was false, and that is inconsistent with a presumption of credibility. There's no extraneous evidence in this case at all. It all relies on whether Dai is telling the truth or not. And there's a presumption that kicks in, and you're saying, well, we you're you're not grounding your argument on whether that presumption was overturned by the Board. Instead, you're saying that the Board presumed he was credible and then did something else. But there's nothing else to be done in the Dai case.

425,19-1155,Neil_Gorsuch_,1709.24,1735.905," Good morning, Ms. Sinzdak. I'd like to explore a slightly different point, and and that is where does this presumption apply. In the government's opening brief, it took the position that it applies only in appeals to the BIA and not in court. The reply brief didn't appear to me to press that point with the vigor of the opening brief, and I'm just curious what what what the government's position is now.
",-0.374518483877182
426,19-1155,Neil_Gorsuch_,1756.65,1777.92," Okay. Let's suppose you're right about that just for the moment. What what difference does that make if a court of of you know, a court of appeals has to review for substantial evidence and reasonableness. Doesn't it have to also inquire as to whether the Board reasonably treated the presumption?
",-0.5873514413833618
427,19-1155,Neil_Gorsuch_,1804.66,1822.155," I I I let me just stop you there. I'm sorry, but you say implicitly, and I I guess I'm wondering how a court could decide that the Board acted reasonably based on an implicit credibility determination when the statute seems to require the Board to make an explicit one.
",-0.05597291886806488
428,19-1155,Neil_Gorsuch_,1839.63,1857.575," Okay. So so we don't have an explicit finding from the IJ. Why wouldn't it be unreasonable, therefore, for the Board to let's just assume for the moment it did implicitly reject the credibility of the of of the witness?
",-0.23554512858390808
429,19-1155,Neil_Gorsuch_,1873.92,1892.78," Okay. But let let let just just let's let's let's assume it's implicit, as as your answer first answer seemed to suggest. Could could the Board reasonably affirm an IJ based on implicit credibility determinations, or would that be something a court of appeals would have to reverse in light of the statute?
",-1.0883476734161377
430,19-1155,Neil_Gorsuch_,1918.055,1954.47," How about I I certainly understand the reluctance of immigration judges and trial judges everywhere to make adverse credibility determinations expressly. It's it's an uncomfortable task. But what what on the other hand, what's so difficult about requiring the government to do just that? I mean, if you point to, as Judge Collins did, you know, eight different problems with Dai's testimony, for example, the probation report in the other case, it surely wouldn't require much more than a few words to to to make express what what's implicit.

431,19-1155,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1977.19,2044.06," Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Ms. Sinzdak. On the statutory language, if I could start there and pick up on Justice Gorsuch's questioning, it says if no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made and you said that's by the IJ the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal. And I just want to know what work the presumption does and on on appeal. In other words, I would think the presumption does work when there's no other evidence at all, other than the testimony of the applicant, and there hasn't been an adverse credibility determination. Then there's then you have that presumption of credibility on appeal, and, presumably, that will sustain the burden. But you can tell me if that's wrong. If there's any other evidence, however, then the presumption, I guess, drops out or the case becomes like any other case. Is that right? Is that your argument, or how do you think about that?
",-0.32801884412765503
432,19-1155,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2150.49,2197.8," Then, on the terminology, there's a lot of confusion obviously inherent in these terms, but I I would think the way you would approach it when with a witness's testimony is you would ask, is the witness lying, first, about whether the light was red or green, for example. The witness knows it was red but testifies it was green. So the witness is lying. That's the first inquiry, is the witness lying? Then the second inquiry would be, even if the witness is not lying, is the witness mistaken or wrong? You know, they truly believe the light was red, but, in fact, the light was green, the other evidence shows. Now that's how I usually think about it, and I'm curious how you think that fits into the term ""credibility."" In other words, is the witness lying? Even if not, is the witness mistaken?
",0.2867204546928406
433,19-1155,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2226.77,2243.66," And won't a finder of fact often say, I'm not quite sure if they're lying, but I still don't think they're correct? They're they're mistaken about the the light being red or green. I'm not quite sure they're lying, but they are mistaken given the other evidence in the record.

434,19-1155,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2261.1,2421.935," Good morning, Ms. Sinzdak. I I have to say join me up with Justices Alito and Kagan. I'm baffled by the distinction that you're drawing between ""credibility"" and ""persuasiveness."" And it's not actually consistent with the way that I've seen cases come up for review in the court of appeals from IJs who make adverse credibility determinations. The ones I've seen, you know, they've essentially been equivalent to saying that the witness is lying. This this fine distinction between ""believable"" and ""believed"" just seems, you know, nitpicking to me. As Justice Kavanaugh was saying, it seems to me more like ""credibility"" refers to are they lying, and then ""persuasiveness,"" as Justice Kavanaugh was suggesting, points to other reasons why you might not believe them. So I could you know, thinking about your example with the child and the crumbs, I was thinking as you talked about an example about my child. I come home and find the child hysterically crying, and she said someone was beating at the door, I think somebody was trying to break into her house our house. And I can believe her. I don't think she's lying. But then my neighbor says, yeah, you know, I I saw it was the UPS man. So I would not find her story persuasive, not because of credibility but because there was other evidence that showed she was not, in fact, in danger. It was the UPS deliveryman. So I don't think that you you seem to be leaning heavily on the fact that the statute uses both the words ""credibility"" and ""persuasiveness,"" and I just don't see it. So I want to ask you what's wrong with seeing it this way: that the IJ makes a determination about credibility, and that has to be express, and when it gets up to the Board, there are two ways in which the Board might have to confront this presumption. Either the IJ actually found the alien incredible and the Board disagrees, in which case it has to confront the presumption and explain why it thinks the evidence rebuts that presumption of credibility, or the IJ might not have done a good enough job in making an adverse credibility determination explicit, as the statute requires, and then, still, the Board has to presume credibility and then explain why it thinks the presumption is rebutted. If the Board offers such an explanation, once it gets up to the court of appeals, the court of appeals isn't applying any kind of presumption. The court of appeals is just reviewing it for substantial evidence and seeing if the Board's explanation and the Board has to show that it understood what presumption should be there whether the Board's explanation was rational and substantial evidence supported its determination that the alien was not telling the truth. Is that an okay way to think about it, and how is that different from your way?
",1.377846121788025
435,19-1155,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2491.23,2507.595," sneak in one more question. Is it your position that IJs actually, on the ground, proceed in the way that you're suggesting, drawing this distinction between someone could believe you, but I don't, and just using ""credibility"" in the way that Justices Alito and Kagan and I have been using it, just as it means truth?

436,19-1155,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2702.565,2732.37," Mr. Katyal, just to be be clear sort of starting out here, the question presented is whether a court of appeals may conclusively presume that an asylum asylum applicant's testimony is credible and true if there's no explicit adversary adverse credibility determination. And and your answer to that is no, the court of appeals cannot conclusively presume that the applicant's testimony is credible and true. Is that right?
",-1.0961130857467651
437,19-1155,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2757.395,2775.82," And I also understand your position to be that there are no magic words here. The the BIA does not specifically have to find that we think doesn't have to have an explicit adverse credibility determination. Is that right?
",-0.3750825524330139
438,19-1155,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2798.195,2813.37," Right. So so what it comes down to in in your view is simply how much of an explanation BIA is required to provide before the court of appeals can say that it implicitly made an adverse credibility determination?
",-1.5120443105697632
439,19-1155,Clarence_Thomas_,2841.45,2867.35," Yes, Mr. Katyal, the I'm a bit confused. The you say that there's no magic word requirement. But what if there is just the the the Board makes a choice or the IJ makes a choice between two sets of evidence? Isn't it implicit that it found one more credible than the other?

440,19-1155,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2966.77,3044.54," Good morning. I I think you and every everyone seems to agree with this: The Ninth Circuit's wrong when they say that you, even though where there's no finding, you assume that the person is credible. That isn't what the statute said. It says where there's no no no finding, you presume, not assume. And so the question is, did the did did is that what the agency did? Did it presume it? No. Well, maybe, because they might have assumed that the presumption was rebutted. So we have a question on appeal. They didn't write whether it was rebutted or not. But that's true of district court judges: When they make a lot of findings that are appealed, they don't always have to write. It could be the situation. It could be implicit from the record that they assumed that it was rebutted. Lower courts or the agency thought the presumption was rebutted. Now you don't have to write about everything on an agency doesn't have to and a district judge doesn't have to. So how do we deal with that?
",0.4295251965522766
441,19-1155,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3081.17,3093.16," but do you think they have to write an opinion where district judges all the time are making rulings where they don't write opinions, and suddenly an administrative law judge has to write an opinion on this matter, on every matter?
",-0.5697593688964844
442,19-1155,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3151.045,3177.035," I don't know that I have very much to add here. The the Ninth Circuit said, and I'm quoting from the opinion in your case, ""We have repeatedly held that where the BIA does not make an explicit adverse credibility finding, the court must assume that the petitioner's factual contentions are true."" I understand you now to acknowledge that that was an inaccurate statement of the law. Isn't that right?
",0.26614293456077576
443,19-1155,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3180.91,3227.74," Okay. So the the BIA can implicitly find that the presumption was rebutted. And then the question does seem to come down to whether it is permissible to read the BIA's opinion as sufficiently stating that they that the that the Board found that that the the requirements for asylum were not met, whether they provided a sufficient explanation. They don't have to do it explicitly, but they have to provide an explanation. That's that's the question, right?
",-0.5832544565200806
444,19-1155,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3261.07,3284.42," Well, the the Board could say could do this, could it not? The alien testified to this, there were other witnesses that testified to this, another witness testified to this. Without going through each witness and saying we believe A, we we disbelieve B, we believe C, they simply say these are the facts that we that we that we find. That would be sufficient, wouldn't it?
",0.17542123794555664
445,19-1155,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3322.475,3364.55," Mr. Katyal, I have a basic problem in this case starting from where Justice Justice Alito did, which is you've admitted the Ninth Circuit applied the wrong presumption. It seems to me that then the only thing that happens is a remand to see exactly what they intended or didn't intend. I do have a problem in this case believing that this ruling was on anything other than credibility, i.e., they that the IJ and the BI and the BIA didn't believe your client with respect to the nature of the assault. Am I correct in that assumption?
",0.06840693205595016
446,19-1155,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3427.325,3447.5," So I think that goes to the basic question. Without a adverse credibility finding or a statement that he is they did not believe or didn't credit his explanation, then, without that finding, you can't uphold their judgment. Is that your argument?
",-0.12199901789426804
447,19-1155,Elena_Kagan_,3474.65,3550.9," Mr. Katyal, this seems like a this this is a pretty simple case, right? There's there's basically two pieces of evidence in it. Mr. Alcaraz says this was nothing, I I I just I didn't really seriously beat my my girlfriend, and I was trying to protect my daughter. And then, on the other hand, you have a probation report. So it comes up to the Board, and because there was no finding, it comes with a presumption of credibility, but the Board is now looking at the probation report and saying, you know, generally, we believe probation reports rather than convicted criminals with incentives to lie, and that's exactly what we're doing here. We're going to believe the probation report that this was an extremely serious crime. So isn't the surrounding circumstances, and then you look at this case, and, basically, it just comes back down to do you believe Mr. Alcaraz or do you believe the probation report, doesn't it isn't it just clear that the Board believed the probation report rather than Mr. Alcaraz? And, if that's so, isn't it clear that, essentially, the Board decided to rebut the presumption?

I'm I'm struggling to identify any other ground on which the BIA could possibly have acted other than it it believed the probation report rather than your client.

450,19-1155,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3747.735,3826.25," Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Katyal. On the statutory language, I'll repeat a question I asked your colleague. It says, the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal if no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made. I think the purpose of that was that if the only real testimony in the record is from the applicant that and the IJ did not say, I think the applicant is lying or make an adverse credibility determination, it would not be open to the BIA to to do that. But, by and this is what I want you to focus on by using the phrase ""rebuttable presumption"" I think Justice Kagan was talking about this and Justice Gorsuch if other evidence comes in, it's not just the applicant's testimony and you have nothing else, other testimony comes in, then that you just do normal substantial evidence review as the reviewing court. And if the BIA has explained, we think the other evidence is inconsistent with the applicant's testimony and and the other evidence is more persuasive or we choose to believe that other evidence, then that rebuts the presumption.

So it seems like you don't quite buy the government's argument that ""credibility"" simply means is this person capable of being believed rather than I believe them, but I did hear you earlier say something about something can be credible and not persuasive on the grounds that you don't believe the person. So can you just tell me what you mean by ""credible,"" how you understand it?

On that example, it's not that the person was lying. It's just that they're mistaken based on other outside evidence. So, there, you're right, they may be credible but not be persuasive. But that's consistent with credibility referring to the truth or falsity of the testimony, is the person lying or not, right?

456,19-1155,Clarence_Thomas_,4325.78,4355.92," Do you think that in this case, in your case, there's quite a bit of evidence that seems to undermine both Respondent's credibility and or at least go could go to credibility and to persuasiveness.

",-0.32343238592147827
457,19-1155,Stephen_G_Breyer_,4437.285,4481.78," Yes, can two things: One, as I read the Ninth Circuit, I thought there's language there that says something like the following: Where there's no adverse credibility determination in the agency, a reviewing court of appeals must assume that the statement was credible. That couldn't be right because, after all, the agency is told that, if there is no adverse credibility requirement, there is a presumption, and so, agency, you can say the presumption is rebutted. Am I right about what the Ninth Circuit is saying or not?
",0.24790853261947632
458,19-1155,Stephen_G_Breyer_,4484.49,4511.42," Well, then that's not right. That isn't right because you could it would be weird to have an agency which says we can write down the words, in this situation, we find the presumption of credibility rebutted because, with the most convincing reasons ever. And the they would have to accept that in a court of appeals, or you're going to get it's not going to make sense. All right. That's my first problem.
",1.5205186605453491
459,19-1155,Stephen_G_Breyer_,4511.62,4593.55," I think we have to say that. But the more serious problem which I really don't understand thoroughly and I'm trying to work out is what happens. No adverse credibility determination. Now there is a presumption. The IJ and the agency think it's a possibly think it was it it was rebutted, that presumption. Now do they have to write those words, ""we find it rebutted,"" or are they implicit? Can a reviewing court ever find them implicit? And, if so, when? What words would you write in an opinion? If you believe the latter, you don't want to give them too much power to disregard what an applicant for refugee status says, but you do not want them to have to write magic words in every case. So what what would you do? What words would you use for to tell the reviewing court be careful about this, where they don't make an explicit finding that it was rebutted, that the presumption was rebutted, no explicit finding?

460,19-1155,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4629.54,4667.72," Well, I I thought I was agreeing with you, but now the last thing you said gives me pause. The Ninth Circuit I I read its opinion as saying here as saying exactly what it said very succinctly in the other case, that unless the BIA makes an explicit finding that the applicant is not credible, it must be presumed that the applicant was credible. That, I think, is a an incorrect statement of the law. And do you disagree that that is that that's the the rule that the Ninth Circuit applied in this case?

461,19-1155,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4725.755,4765.085," Can the BIA's decision be read in this way: Dai had the burden of showing that he was unwilling to return to to China because of fear of persecution, and we do not believe that he had that fear; he did not establish that he actually is unwilling to return to China based on the the fact that he was less than truthful in or less than forthright in his explanation of of his family's travels and his own plans?
",-0.023342590779066086
462,19-1155,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4838.45,4899.655," Well, the IJ here did find explicitly that Dai's explanation for his wife's return to China are inadequate and to outweigh that they returned, not because of persecution, and then he says Dai failed to prove his burden. The BIA affirmed that Dai had lied to the asylum officer because the truth would be perceived as inconsistent with his claims of past and fear and fear of future persecution. That, to me, suggests the conclusion that Justice Alito suggested. So, if that is possible given what they did say, why isn't an automatic remand appropriate?
",0.3326606750488281
463,19-1155,Elena_Kagan_,4942.93,5051.915," Mr. Zimmer, I want to work off the understanding of law that you started with, which is the same as the one Justice Barrett was using, which is that this presumption of credibility, what it says is that in the absence of a finding we are going to take the the testimony of the applicant as as honest, as truthful. The applicant didn't perjure himself. But then there are there is extraneous evidence that could come in to show that the applicant was wrong. And and and that distinction actually makes all the sense in the world in a statute like this, which is about a well-grounded fear of persecution, that the applicant can testify as to his fear and all the things underlying it. But then there can be other evidence which shows that that fear is not well grounded, notwithstanding the truthfulness of what the applicant said. So let's take that as the sort of premise of what the statute does. Dai, it seems to me, could have lost in two ways in in that world. One is if we understand the Board to have rejected the the the the presumption of credibility. In other words, they have decided that, in fact, Dai was lying when he said that this was the reason that he wanted asylum. And the second is, no, they accepted that he was telling the truth, but there is extraneous evidence indicating that he's wrong as to his fear of going back to China. So if you could comment on either of those two ways of saying that Dai was wrong and why you think neither of those is supportable.

474,19-511,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,529.31,610.47," Sorry. Mr. Clement, the statutory phrase that we have to interpret in this case has a structure that is fairly common. It lists two activities, ""storing or producing telephone numbers,"" followed by a modifying phrase, ""using a random or sequential number generator."" People make statements like that all the time, and, you know what, those who hear them or read them understand what they mean without looking at treatises on grammar syntax, usage, or interpretation. And the way they do that is to ask, what makes sense? I can give you lots of examples, but I have very little time for questioning, so they they ask about the sense of it before they get to all this arcane stuff. So the question that jumps out here is this: Does it make any sense to speak about storing a list of telephone numbers using a random or sequential number generator? And the best answer I can find in the briefs on your side is that there were systems that produced lists of numbers using such a generator and then stored them. But, unless you can explain how a generator was used in the very process of storing the numbers, I think you have a problem.

475,19-511,Sonia_Sotomayor_,687.99999995,739.015," Mr. Clement, with your parade of horribles that, if read the way the other side wants, it would cover devices, too many devices, I'm wondering if the issue is less with Respondents' interpretation and more so with the TCPA being outdated. When the Act was passed nearly 30 years ago, smartphones didn't even exist. Even today, it still references pagers, the TCPA. But you are right to note that today almost all phones have the ability to store and dial telephone numbers. If what Congress wanted to do was stop a call that was automatic and that's what it accomplished, wouldn't it be its job, not ours, to update the TCPA to bring it in line with the times?

So here is the sentence: It is illegal to stab or shoot another person using a firearm. And what I want to know is, would I be covered if I stabbed somebody with a knife?

477,19-511,Neil_Gorsuch_,939.505,1014.33," Good morning, Mr. Clement. You you pressed what Judge Barrett in her opinion on for the Seventh Circuit called the first potential reading. But the problem that it generates, as everybody's recognized, so to speak, is that it's awkward to speak of of equipment storing anything using a random number generator. That's what Justice Alito and Justice Kagan have pointed out. One potential response to that might be that what what Judge Barrett called the fourth potential reading, which is to say that the phrase ""using a random or sequential number generator"" modifies the object rather than the verbs. And it would be sensible to talk about storing telephone numbers to be called that are to be called using a random number generator. The problem there, of course, is the comma. I I I see all that. All right? My question for you is is you didn't raise the fourth argument as a potential. I'm not sure we need to rule it out. Would it would it make any difference to you and your clients and and in any sensible way make a difference in the real world whether we were adopting the first alternative or or saying that the fourth might be a possibility too?

I want to touch on what you talked about what Congress was getting at in 1991 and just make sure I understand the structure of the statute. Your point about calls to the home, only artificial or prerecorded calls to the home were prohibited, why didn't Congress also prohibit live calls, live telemarketing calls, to the home do you think?
",-0.7346965074539185
479,19-511,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1114.35,1154.66999995," Okay. And then, when you get to the other category of calls we're talking about, to the specialized numbers, Congress again prohibits the artificial or prerecorded voice calls but then also prohibits calls which would, presumably, be live caller calls using an ATS an ATS ATDS. What was, in your view, Congress getting at with those calls? Am I right in thinking those are live caller calls that would necessarily be covered by the ATDS prohibition?

481,19-511,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1245.585,1287.255," Mr. Clement, some of the lower courts that have adopted your opponent's interpretation have been moved by the exception in (B), which says that liability doesn't attach if the call is made for emergency purposes or with the prior express consent of the called party. And, you know, they've pointed out that, under your interpretation, they say: Listen, the prior express consent would do no work for an ATDS. I'm looking at the emergency purposes exception to liability, and I'm wondering how either an ATDS or an automated or artificial prerecorded voice device would make a call for emergency purposes.

However, I mean, it it may not be that there's very wide applicability for either one of those exceptions, including the one for emergency services, which I think would deprive the objection of some of its force, that your interpretation renders the prior consent of not great utility.

Mr. Ellis, the Justice Sotomayor brought up the point of the ill fit between this statute from 1991 and current technology, which is advanced. In '91, cell phones, or quite a few of them, were the size of a loaf of bread, and they're not in widespread use. Lots of people had car phones instead installed in their cars. The we've had, in legislation, quite a change. The industry's changed. The technology is far beyond anything we could have conceived of in '91. At what point do we simply say and I understand the statutory construction and the the what we're attempting to do with this statute, but at what point do we say this statute is an ill fit for current technology?

The first is the one that I asked Mr. Clement: does it make any sense to talk about a system that uses a a random or sequential number generator in the very process of storing telephone numbers? The second is this: in order for your interpretation to be right, don't you have to show that there are or were systems that stored numbers using such a generator but didn't use the generator to produce the numbers? If otherwise, there wouldn't be any point in separately covering storage. So, if you could cover those two in perhaps in reverse order, I would appreciate it.

It doesn't seem like a smartphone can be an Automatic Telephone Dialing System. Am I missing something? Why wasn't that the the the main reason for reading things against the Respondent reading this reading this law as not applying to the Respondent?
",-0.5999525189399719
488,19-511,Elena_Kagan_,2006.145,2035.755," Mr. Ellis, at the time the TCPA was enacted, there were a fair number of state statutes that dealt with the same general subject matter area, and every single one of those statutes defined an autodialer to encompass at least some machines that didn't use a random or sequential number generator. So doesn't that suggest that your definition is wrong? I mean, would Congress really have wanted to depart from all of those state statutes in this particular way?
",-0.3234199285507202

I mean, if I understand what you're saying, you're saying that Congress decided to cover these predictive dialers when there was an automated or prerecorded voice but not when there was a live person on the line. What what sense would that have made? What difference does it make from the recipient of the call's perspective?

490,19-511,Neil_Gorsuch_,2166.52,2213.21999995," Good morning, Mr. Ellis. Two questions. Take them in whatever order you care. First, I think your argument depends upon the possibility that, in the world at the time Congress adopted the statute, there were devices that used random number generators to store telephone numbers. So what evidence do you have that that exists existed in the world, number one? Number two, the same question I posed to Mr. Clement with respect to what Judge Barrett in her excellent opinion called the fourth possible interpretation. I understand the problems with it, but it does overcome this difficulty. And it it wasn't addressed in the briefs, and I'm just curious why it wasn't addressed and whether we need to rule it out, whether it would make any difference going with the first versus the fourth?

491,19-511,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2324.175,2356.715," Thank you. And good morning, Mr. Ellis. Justice Thomas and Justice Sotomayor, I think, and others have talked about the ill fit of the statutory language to current technology, and I want to break that down with you a bit because there are two as you've indicated, two prohibitions here. One is the prohibition on artificial or prerecorded voice calls, and that covers artificial or prerecorded voice calls to the house or to these specialized lines.
",-0.1438610702753067
492,19-511,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2363.095,2405.755," Okay. So then you have the ATDS prohibition, which only applies to the calls to specialized lines, does not apply to calls to the house, and because artificial and prerecorded calls are already prohibited, must be getting at something different than artificial and prerecorded calls. And I'm trying to figure out, one, what what what's that getting at at the time, what was the real-world problem; and, two, does that have any relevance at all today, as Justice Thomas and Justice Sotomayor were indicating, with the ATDS prohibition?
",-0.26607510447502136
493,19-511,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2463.15,2525.03," So, Mr. Ellis, some of the lower courts have characterized this provision as ambiguous and, you know, said that that leaves the FCC some room to choose whether this applies, you know, to this kind of pre-stored situation or not. And you, in your colloquy with the Chief Justice, suggested that although the FCC, you know, may have a narrow band of authority, you weren't ruling that out either. And I guess I'm wondering if you could explain why you think any kind of Chevron deference would apply here, where we have two conflicting choices and we have to decide which is the best one, because I would have thought that Chevron that the premise of it is that when Congress deliberately chooses open-ended language or vague language, it's implicitly delegated to the agency a range of discretion to make the choice. But this kind of thorny statutory provision doesn't strike me as reflecting an implicit congressional choice to delegate to the FCC how to regulate this.

495,19-511,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2859.185,2892.655," Well, lawyers too, I guess, but the the the point is that Congress didn't write the legislation with the technical rules in mind, and I think ordinary speakers wouldn't read them that way.

I think we're talking about the average person. Most people would have no idea today what some of the technology was in in in 1991, a pager. The most people would not realize that caller IDs were cutting-edge and had to be purchased separately, that most people did not have cell phones. In fact, very few people did, and they were large. And car phones had to be installed. So technology has changed and moved along very rapidly. And don't you think it's rather odd that we are applying a statute that's almost anachronistic, if not vestigial and to a to to modern technology like Facebook and instant messaging, et cetera? Don't you think that at some point there's a there's at least a sense of futility?

499,19-511,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3197.78,3258.835," Then, over time, what happens is the world changes so everybody and his uncle has a system that fits within that ordinary definition of cell phones storing, then automatically dialing. We all have one. And so it gets too broad. And so should you narrow it? Now that seems like the converse of a situation where, you know, the famous you know all these examples, the the the silver fox is not thought to be an endangered animal, an endangered species, when they wrote the statute, but later it is, and so you say, well, there's a dynamic meaning which changes over time to pick things up, or it's a static meaning, just look back to see what they intended at the time. And Nino Scalia always used to say, oh, that's just done to expand the statute. But, here, we're using it to contract the statute. Any comment? Is that totally wrong? I suddenly began to think about it that way.

500,19-511,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3273.34,3314.72," if we do that. You say ""wither,"" that's pejorative. But in the in so often we interpret a statute dynamically to adapt to changing circumstances, looking at the context in which it is passed and how it's changed, in order to decide how to do so. And to do so here, there are a few words over there that really help. Is there anything wrong with reading a statute, looking for the intent in terms of change over time, did Congress intend it to change over time as technology changed, and then using the tools at hand in the context at hand to produce a more sensible interpretation?

But we haven't claimed it so far, and assuming we don't, perhaps we have to put out of our mind the whole parade of horribles that arises as a result of the advent of smartphones and social media. So, if we think about the technology that existed at the time when this statute was enacted, the the biggest technology that seems to me to provide the the greatest practical problem for your interpretation is call forwarding, which I think was widely available when this statute was enacted.

506,19-511,Elena_Kagan_,3685.125,3727.49," Mr. Mr. Garner, you started off by noting that there are some kinds of statutes or sentences where the meaning of the words is so clear that the mind gravitates toward the ungrammatical reading. And that might well be, but but would you at least acknowledge that the reading that you're asking us to adopt is, in fact, ungrammatical? That you have two verbs, ""store"" and ""produce."" They have a shared direct object, ""numbers to be called."" And then a modifier following all of that. So sort of setting aside the semantic arguments for the moment, do you do you agree that the grammar favors Facebook?

And, there, the meaning is so clear because you can't imagine eminent domain being used to maintain land. It's kind of like what is that's impossible. And so too for your argument in your brief about, you know, what does it mean for a domestic airline to drive. But I think that the point that Mr. Clement might make here is that the meaning here is not so impossible. You know, there's a little bit of awkwardness about saying that a number generator stores numbers, but, actually, that can be explained by looking at the kinds of dialing devices that existed at the time, where there were devices that generated numbers for immediate dialing and devices that stored numbers for later dialing. So so, if that meaning is possible, shouldn't we go with that meaning when combined with the fact that it's the most grammatically proper way to read the sentence?

And and I I think you you have certainly have an argument that grammar doesn't exhaust meaning, fine. But on what basis is this sentence grammatical? I I think it's so awkward I'd anticipate you'd rewrite it if it were given to you. And when when we look at the adverbial phrase, there's nothing to indicate in the statute that it that it modifies only one of the verbs. And rules of grammar usually indicate that when you have a clause like that offset by a comma, it would modify both of the prior verbs, right?

And I guess I'm still a little unclear about the answer there. To store a number, if it's totally divorced from the random or sequential number generator, and then to dial such number would seem to be enough. Others have worried about our our contemporary cell phones that can do that. But even in at the time of the statute's adoption, there were phones that captured numbers that had been dialed and you could press redial. Why wouldn't and that was common even even in the 1990s, I believe. Certainly a lot earlier than cell phones. Why wouldn't this statute make a a criminal of us all?

And and, you know, many people, your opponents, several of the lower courts, the Seventh Circuit in Gadelhak has said that it seems like on one reading of the text the auto reply function would be brought within and within the statute.

521,19-199,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,135.155,182.11," Counsel, let's begin with 231g since this is an RRA case, and it says that what's subject to judicial review are ""decisions of the Board determining the rights or liabilities of any person under the Act."" Now Board determinations the Act is just chock full of them. They're they're determining substantive things like who's eligible for how much money, who's eligible for annuity, what are the benefits for spouses, where does the money come from. Nothing like a decision about whether to reopen. So shouldn't we look at that under the RRA in determining whether or not such procedural questions are subject to judicial review?
",-0.4946156144142151
522,19-199,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,197.905,214.155," So maybe in the maybe in the abstract, you can say, well, this is a determination of a right. But the phrase ""determinations of the Board,"" it's almost a term of art in the statute. They're and they're talking about rights and liabilities in a substantive way.

524,19-199,Clarence_Thomas_,462.185,486.675," But how far do you go with that, Ms. Harris? The what if we denied cert or denied petition for rehearing of cert in a case that totally involves state law?

525,19-199,Stephen_G_Breyer_,529.475,577.675," Well, my question was basically the same as the Chief Justice's, and it seems to me on that question you have going against you, first, the language of it, of rights and liabilities, read in light of what we said in two cases. It's both Your Home Visiting Nurse and also Califano v. Sanders. Then you have the fact that nobody no lower court decided in your favor, I think maybe there was an exception, I don't know since the 1960s or 1970s, and since then, the cases have gone the other way in the lower courts, and it would make a kind of hash of the statute of limitations. Otherwise, you have the presumption of judicial review in your favor. So I want to see if there's anything you want to add on the negative part.

528,19-199,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,776.52,805.77," Well, is that true under the language of the provision? It says: ""Decisions of the Board determining the rights or liabilities of any person under this subchapter shall be subject to judicial review."" That tells us what is subject to judicial review. But then it goes on to say, in the same manner, subject to the same limitations, et cetera, as the RUIA. That tells us how the review takes place. Why do you think that specifies what is reviewable?

529,19-199,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,836.94,890.01," Well, what takes me aback in approaching the case in this way is that both you and the government, who are more immersed in this than we are, have spent a lot of time debating judicial review under the provisions of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. So do you think that unacceptable anomalies would occur if we were to decide the review question here without considering or deciding the review question under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act? And because my my time is is going to expire, let me fold in one other question. How often does review occur under these two different acts? Is there a big difference in the number of cases?

You just mentioned the employer determination. But wouldn't that basically be a determination, an initial determination, of entitlement to to benefits?
",-0.48107674717903137
531,19-199,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1022.71,1079.76," I I I guess I'm still a little troubled, and I'm sorry for my denseness, but it seems to me that all of those questions under 355 that you speak about go to the initial determination of rights or liabilities of any person. It's basically saying this kind of employer is liable or not liable to you. That's a clear determination of rights or liabilities under the Act, and so it still would be subject to judicial review. But hearkening back to what Justice Thomas said, at least in Home Services, we thought of or could think of and I understand it was because of the regulatory scheme that a motion to reopen was not a new determination of rights or benefits, that it was a decision not to reconsider that question. So why shouldn't we think of it that way here?

And this really goes back to Justice Breyer's question. And I wasn't quite sure I understood your answer to him, because he said, well, I understand the decision distinction you're making the distinction you're making and and and but where do we get that distinction from the statutory language? Why is one determining rights and liabilities and the other is not?

If I could just sort of simplify 355, it would read like this: Any claimant, any railway labor organization, any base-year employer, or any other party aggrieved by a final decision under subsection (c). Why wouldn't the ""under subsection (c)"" language apply to each of those three identified and one catch-all party?

534,19-199,Neil_Gorsuch_,1357.87,1430.77," Good morning, Ms. Harris. Let me pick up right there. Let let let's suppose for the purposes of this question that I agree with you that under 355(f), reopening petitions could be reviewed under the RUIA. But let's also suppose that the language in 231g suggests that reopening petitions under the RRA cannot. And that that leads to kind of an anomaly, I think we'd all agree, and I'm not sure I could understand the rational reason for the distinction, which makes me wonder what about 355(g), which, as you know, suggests that findings of fact and conclusions of law by the Board in their determination of claims are final and conclusive on all persons? And let you know, it makes me wonder whether Congress ever anticipated the idea of reopening decisions or even authorized them. And if Congress didn't authorize them, if they were never anticipated, if they just simply weren't permitted under 355(g), what should that tell us about both (f) 355(f) and 231g?
",-0.0633084774017334
535,19-199,Neil_Gorsuch_,1495.55,1523.005," Why doesn't it suggest, though, that this is purely a matter of regulatory grace and it isn't it isn't contemplated, required, or maybe even authorized by statute, but it's something the executive can do and and that we really have no role in? It can only benefit a claimant to have a reopening. It can't harm a claimant. And at that point, we have nothing to say on the matter.
",0.5973802208900452
536,19-199,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1584.355,1713.265," Good morning, Ms. Harris. I want to pick up on something Justice Breyer brought up about the history of this issue and case law, because my understanding's very different from his, and I just wanted to get that out there, and you can respond. So here's my understanding of what's happened on this issue over the years: In 1966, Judge Friendly issued an opinion for the Second Circuit that said there was judicial review of these kinds of reopenings, and that's been the law in the Second Circuit for 54 years now. It's in a ""but see"" in the government's brief, but that's been the law in in the Second Circuit. Then along comes Califano in 1977, dealing, of course, with a different act with different language, and says no judicial review there. And then the courts of appeals essentially pick up on Califano in this context without paying attention, in my view, to the to the language difference in Califano, and you see the Seventh Circuit and the Fifth, Fourth, and Third all kind of go on the call Califano road, also a little bit with the greater includes the lesser point. And Califano doesn't work, as I think the government itself was going to have to acknowledge here, and so they're back-filling with textual arguments on 355(f), which you've answered, and then 231g. And I just would point out I think this is right, but you tell me if I'm wrong the government has never argued in this way the 231g point in all these cases. You know, you go back and look at the briefs and it's just not been part of that, presumably, because they've long understood, the Railroad Board at least, has long understood that denials of reopening, just like grants of reopening, obviously change your benefits if it's a grant of reopening, and so a denial too determines your rights and liabilities. So I think that I guess my understanding of the history of this is quite a bit different in terms of the case law in going back to Judge Friendly's opinion and what Justice Breyer said. And you can I mean, that's a favorable question to you, obviously. But, if you want to fill in any gaps there, go ahead.
",0.24407048523426056
537,19-199,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1788.205,1827.9," Good morning, Ms. Harris. So, in thinking about the 231g question and whether the denial of a motion to reopen determines rights or liabilities, I think, when you look at 261.2 and the regulations, if you're thinking about 261.2(b), you know, if a denial is essentially a conclusion that there was no new or material evidence of error, then I can see how that might qualify as a determination of a right or a liability. But what about in Mr. Salinas's case? I mean, is it fair to to characterize his motion here as a motion to reconsider the denial of his motion to reopen (b)(4)?
",-0.5579944252967834
538,19-199,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1915.66,1945.2," Let me expand it beyond Mr. Salinas's motion here, because what I'm getting at is, even if you could consider some grounds for not reopening a determination of rights or liabilities, I'm not sure that's true of all. So, for example, what if it's just flatly that somebody came forward beyond the four years permitted in 261.2(b) and they just said, sorry, it's late? That's not really it doesn't fit neatly into the definition determination of rights or liabilities.
",0.7429355382919312
539,19-199,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2183.035,2209.255," Mr. Raynor, I don't think I heard you mention 231g. Maybe I I missed it. But you don't get to it in the arguments section of your brief until 13 pages into it. The the question is judicial review under the RRA. There is a provision in the RRA that talks about judicial review. Why why don't why are you so shy about that one?
",-0.00402274401858449
540,19-199,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2224.78,2245.46," it it makes some decisions reviewable to the same extent as under the RUIA, but you have to go through its discussion of what decisions are. It's determination of rights or liabilities. They have to be under the Act. Do you need a decision that covers 355(f) to decide this case?
",-1.310172438621521
541,19-199,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2312.125,2330.105," Well, you say just a plain meaning approach with, it sounds, a little bit of disdain, but why the the RRA program is the vast majority of rail railroad benefits, right? I mean, the RUIA is just a tail on the dog, right?
",-0.21305981278419495
542,19-199,Clarence_Thomas_,2335.14,2359.445," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Raynor, the I, with the Chief I agree with the Chief Justice in wondering why you're so reluctant to argue 231g, but let me ask you this: The could the agency do away with the whole process of reopening?
",-0.931037187576294
543,19-199,Clarence_Thomas_,2369.575,2393.305," If that's the case, how could it be then that it's a final decision if it's purely discretionary? I think the hard connection for me to make is, how do you get from a discretionary decision with respect to reopening to the underlying issue of benefits?
",-0.668695867061615
544,19-199,Clarence_Thomas_,2410.775,2452.43500005," So that would be a final decision. And I think the other side of that argument, though, would be the decision not to reopen would be a denial of the benefit, even if you don't reconsider or hear more evidence. What what do you make of Ms. Harris's distinction between rehearing or reopening petitions in cases of where there's just a rehash of the underlying evidence, as opposed to the cases or as compared to the cases or distinguished from the cases involving additional evidence?
",-0.7887240052223206
545,19-199,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2503.735,2557.32," Thank you. It it doesn't say there isn't review. There is a very, very strong presumption of judicial review. Both briefs make good arguments on 355(c). And I bet when I read Judge Henry Henry Friendly, it's a pretty good argument. And I guess you could interpret rights and liabilities I mean, there is language certainly in your favor in that Your Home case. But you might interpret it as being a final decision in respect to rights and liabilities because he wants the rights and liabilities rule changed because of dah-dah-dah. Okay. So why isn't there enough ambiguity and no forbidding of it that you just get under regular judicial review? The APA. Final decision, unlawful, dah-dah.

546,19-199,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2651.21,2676.5," There are people in the government who understand these schemes very well, and, therefore, I assume there is a reason why you led off with the argument based on the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act rather than just the provision of the Railroad Retirement Act. What is that?
",-0.7565909624099731
547,19-199,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2712.85,2736.96," Well, I'm not sure I understand the answer. Is is the answer that you really think that it would be a mistake it would be it would be wrong as a matter of law or it would create anomalies if we were to decide the case based solely on 231g?

And you say you don't think there will be serious anomalies. Can you guarantee there aren't? Are you absolutely sure?

549,19-199,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2805.12,2842.665," So you've answered my question, counsel. You argue that we need not decide, at least in your brief, whether adopting your interpretation would foreclose challenges to the denial of reopening on constitutional grounds. But, in the brief he submitted during his administrative appeal, Salinas appeared to make sort of a due process argument, claiming he lacked the mental capacity to understand the procedures for requesting review. Let's say we found Salinas's claim to be colorable. Would there be jurisdiction for judicial review?
",-0.15165330469608307
550,19-199,Elena_Kagan_,2902.05,2946.67000005," Okay. Could I ask you about how this cross-reference really works? Because it's quite confusing to me. You know, it says ""decisions of the Board determining rights and liabilities."" And then it, you know, gets you over to 355 because it says, ""as though the decision were a determination of corresponding rights or liabilities under the But the RUIA never uses this language of ""rights or liabilities."" So how do you exactly know what decisions are reviewable you know, what what how the RUIA treats decisions of rights or liabilities when the RUIA uses the term ""final decision""?
",-0.11442745476961136
551,19-199,Elena_Kagan_,2962.82,2982.34," So is that to say, Mr. Raynor, that you're reading this as essentially just a synonym for the final decision language in 355? In other words, that you would say as though the decision were a determination of corresponding rights or liabilities under the RUIA means the same thing as as though the decision were a final decision under the RUIA?
",-1.358504295349121
552,19-199,Neil_Gorsuch_,3000.075,3053.22000005," Good morning, counsel. I want to follow up on Justice Sotomayor's inquiry about constitutional challenges. Page 15 and 16 of the brief, you say, foreclosing garden-variety reopening motions like the one here would not raise any distinct issue of a rare case in which the denial of reopening might be challenged on constitutional grounds. If we were to adopt your view either on 231 or 355(c), there would be appear to be no statutory basis to allow judicial review of any reopening decision. Where does this special exception for constitutional challenges come from and how do we know what a good one a garden-variety one is compared to a really the merits would determine our jurisdiction? I guess I'm just curious how all that follows.

553,19-199,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3101.05,3146.34," Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Raynor. On the greater includes the lesser argument that I understand you to be making in part, namely, that the government's they're not required to grant reopening, so if they if they allow reopening, they can deny judicial review, I mean, that's not usually how administrative law works. You know, yes, you have discretion whether to provide this particular kind of avenue for relief, but I I'm not aware of examples like this where, but, if we do so, we can just cut off all judicial review of it. What's your response to that?

So it is possible that the reopening petition, the Board will mistakenly deny reopening, and the rail the railroad worker should then should have received benefits. And so I don't know about saying it's above and beyond. In that case, the worker should have gotten the benefits, did not, and you're saying no judicial review?

555,19-199,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3204.85,3228.21000005," But the whole point sorry to interrupt, but the whole point of these is that there is often new evidence that could not have been presented at the time. That's the point. It's not a rehash. There's new evidence that shows that the initial determination was wrong. And you're saying even if the Board makes a mistake on the reopening, mis-evaluates the new evidence, no judicial review, forget about it?

556,19-199,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3233.81,3272.71999995," No, that's I I understand your larger point on that. You said earlier that there was no and you've just reiterated, I guess no pressing need for judicial review here. I guess I'm not sure about that, given the example I just gave. But, on the flip side, the burden on the courts seems to be almost nil. In the D.C. Circuit, at least, in the last five years, trouble finding any case that involved judicial review of a denied reopening in this context.

On 231g, I understood your answer to Justice Kagan to be actually that's right, the government has never argued before in the many decades of this that you could resolve this on 231g alone. Indeed, 231g did not really appear in a lot of the government's position in arguing these cases over the decades. Is that accurate?

So, counsel, when the Chief Justice asked you if there would be a practical problem in having a different scope of review under the RRA and the RUIA, you said: Well, it would be conforming to our view of 355. So, in other words, if we interpret 355 the way you would like us to to cover review only of claims under 355(c), then it's the exact same for both. But what if we disagree with you? What if we say no, review under 355 is of any final decision, and so then there may be a different scope. What practical problems might arise then?

559,19-199,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3414.57,3434.78000005," Is the reason why the government would prefer for us to decide this under 355 is that it then takes care of narrowing making sure that the scope is the same and the narrow one that you proposed for purposes of both the RUIA and the RRA, as opposed to using 231g, which narrows only RRA claims?

In other words, so long as it's a time, place, or manner restriction, it's only when there's a difference and it's between minority voters and white voters that you have a problem. Is that not true?

What would you think of Professor Stephanopoulos's test, basically, or standards which bring in from Title VI, Title VII, The Housing Act, the the ADA, you know, it uses roughly the same approach and there would be an opportunity for the state to say we have a good non-race-related reason for doing this. And, therefore, whatever result is, fewer fewer minorities use it, but it's not on account of race, it's on account of our good reason.

If you can't vote because you are a Native American or a non-Hispanic in areas where car ownership rates are very small, where you don't have mail pickup or mail delivery, where your post office is at the edge of town and so that you require either a relative to pick up your vote, or you happen to vote in a wrong precinct because your particular area has a confusion of precinct assignments, if you just can't vote for those reasons and you're not and your vote is not being counted, you've been denied the right to vote, haven't you?

It found no meaningful threat whatsoever. Perceived threat, but none. And with respect to voting out of precinct, there was no finding by the district court that the ballots couldn't be easily counted.

570,19-1257,Elena_Kagan_,1159.04,1194.68," Mr. Carvin, I have a number of hypotheticals for you, and I'd I'd be grateful if we could run through these fairly quickly just so I can get an understanding of your position. So the first one is that the state decides that each county can have one polling place, and because of who lives in in in larger counties, that creates a a a a a disparate impact that black voters have to wait in line for 10 times the amount that white voters do, two-and-a-half hours instead of 15 minutes. Is that system equally open in the language of the statute?
",-0.6644920706748962
571,19-1257,Elena_Kagan_,1212.64,1238.8," That's helpful that's helpful, Mr. Carvin. A state has long had two weeks of early voting, and then the state decides that it's going to get rid of Sunday voting on those two weeks, leave everything else in place. That black voters vote on Sunday 10 times more than white voters. Is is that system equally open?
",-0.34098777174949646
572,19-1257,Elena_Kagan_,1266.48,1284.36," Thank you, Mr. Carvin. Can we go just go on to another one? The state says we're placing all our polling places at country clubs. And that decision means that black voters have to drive 10 times as long to the polls and have to go into places which, you know, are traditionally hostile to them.
",0.09525419026613235
573,19-1257,Elena_Kagan_,1305.08,1322.52," The state says we're going to have Election Day voting only, and it's going to be from 9 to 5. And there's plenty of evidence on the record that voters of one races are 10 times more likely to work a job that wouldn't allow them to vote during that time period. Is that system equally open?

574,19-1257,Neil_Gorsuch_,1377.96,1399.72," Good morning, Mr. Carvin. I'd like to return to some questions Justice Thomas touched on. What is the relationship between your test focused on opportunities and the test that the Solicitor General's brief at least suggested about causation and the need for maybe a proximate causation test?
",-1.5775048732757568
575,19-1257,Neil_Gorsuch_,1481.84,1502.56," All right. And then the other question Justice Thomas touched on that I want to dig down a little bit further on is you speak of equality of opportunity. Does that permit any de minimis distinctions, or does it require equality of opportunity under all circumstances?

576,19-1257,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1536.36,1566.68," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Carvin. Your brief says, ""Ordinary race-neutral regulations of the time, place, and manner of voting do not violate Section 2."" And that, of course, will put a lot of pressure on the word ""ordinary."" Can you tell us how courts are supposed to distinguish ordinary regulations from extraordinary regulations?
",-1.033281922340393
577,19-1257,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1682.76,1716," You referred to common sense. And I think two factors among others, but two factors that, as a matter of common sense, as I think about it, would trigger more suspicion. One factor would be if you're changing to a new rule that puts minorities in a worse position than they were under the old rule, and a second factor would be whether a rule is commonplace in other states that do not have a similar history of racial discrimination. Do those two considerations matter under your view of Section 2?

578,19-1257,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1754.16,1772.44," Mr. Carvin, I want to make sure that I understand your position because it strikes me that it has some contradictions in it. So, as I understood from your brief, your position is that Section 2 does not apply to the how, to the time, place, and manner restrictions, as long as they're facially neutral, that it's only about the who. Am I right about that?
",-0.42819952964782715
579,19-1257,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1782.8,1801.6," Okay. But then I don't understand why you conceded in your examples to Justice Kagan that some of those time, place, and manner restrictions like time, place, and manner, you can only vote at a country club, or time, place, and manner, you know, this is the placement of the polls and they're going to be placed in areas that are burdensome to minorities.

Really, the the pressure under your interpretation is looking at opportunity and what opportunity means. I don't see why time, place, and manner really bears you know, carries a lot of weight in your analysis. Can you explain to me --

581,19-1257,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1896.24,1923.6," let me move on to a different question. I'm interested in knowing why the RNC is in the case. So, you know, the DNC had standing and the district court said that it had standing to challenge the out-of-precinct policy because the policy placed a greater imperative on Democratic organizations to educate their voters and because the policy harmed its members who would have voted out-of-precinct. What's the interest of the Arizona RNC here in keeping, say, the out-of-precinct voter ballot disqualification rules on the books?

582,19-1257,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2171.68,2190.76," I'm sorry, counsel. When you're looking at the impact, do you look at alternative procedures? In other words, let's say there's a significant impact on for on minorities voting at the polls. In analyzing that, do you say, well, they can vote by mail, so, overall, it's not that substantial an impact?
",-0.2747611999511719
583,19-1257,Clarence_Thomas_,2246.44,2276.88," The there was a the theory that the Ninth Circuit used to discuss some questionable legislative intent involved in the Arizona legislation was the cat's paw theory. One, I'd like you to address that, but I'd also like you to tell us to discuss how you would determine the intent of the Arizona legislature in passing this legislation.
",-0.9659165740013123
584,19-1257,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2345.92,2434.04," I'm curious to know what you think of of Professor Stephanopoulos's test. My reason is simply this: It seems to me that in many discrimination statutes anti-discrimination, Title VII, Title VI, the Housing Act, the age discrimination essentially, the courts have come down in disparate impact situations to three elements. First, the plaintiff has to show that there is some kind of significant disparity. Second, the plaintiff has to show that there is at least a but-for cause and the state's or the employer's policy is the but-for cause. And then, third, the defendant can come back and show, well, we have a good non-race-related reason for this and it can't be accomplished easily in other ways. Those three elements run through the law. Many of the tests, and Stephanopoulos, who says it explicitly, embody those three elements. Are you against our saying those same three elements that implemented the statutory language here are the basis of a cause, we'll never get it perfect, it will always be case by case, it will always involve all the circumstances, but those are the three key elements?
",0.17679786682128906
585,19-1257,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2580.88,2613.48," Okay. Let me go on to another another point. You say we should give some teeth to the requirement that challengers must show not only that a protected class has less opportunity to to participate in the political process but also less opportunity to elect representatives of their choice. What would that look like in practice? Does it require pointing to a very close election on on a particular day?
",-0.6394087672233582
586,19-1257,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2639.44,2662.76," Counsel, you said that the general test under Title VII and other civil rights statutes in response to Justice Breyer puts the burden on the state. But the only burden that that test requires is for the state to justify its practice, to explain why. Why is that a burden that you can't meet?
",-0.9688928723335266
587,19-1257,Elena_Kagan_,2887,2905," Yes, it does have a substantial impact, General. You know, if it's 10 to 2, people who work 10 to 2 and don't have cars and and the impact has been shown to be that black voters will be very disproportionately impacted by hours that are 10 to 2.
",0.26437118649482727
588,19-1257,Neil_Gorsuch_,2947,2963," All right. So we we have before us two actual voting practices, the in-precinct requirement and the rule against vote collection or harvesting. Can you explain in in succinctly your thoughts on why those don't count as substantial burdens?
",-1.5684900283813477
589,19-1257,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3064,3091," Thank you, Chief Justice. Counsel, you acknowledged several times that the totality of the circumstances are relevant here, and, of course, that's in the statutory text, as my colleagues have pointed out. Is the availability of alternatives that could serve your policy goals a circumstance that matters when we consider the totality of the circumstances?
",-1.2839261293411255
590,19-1257,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3150,3225," So, General, one of the disputes in this case about is about whether we look at the electoral system as a whole or whether we look at the challenged regulation in isolation or let's say on a regulation-by-regulation basis. And I want to give you this point or this example that's in Secretary Hobbs's brief, she makes a pretty good point. She says in response to your argument that we have to look at the process itself to say, overall, is the process, you know, open enough for disadvantaged voters. So, you know, even if they can't send their ballot in via ballot collection, they have many other opportunities to do so, early voting, et cetera. She points out in Footnote 6 on page 23 that if a state sends unsolicited ballot applications to residents of white neighborhoods but not to residents of black neighborhoods, that would amount to giving the latter less opportunity to participate. And she's, you know, quoting the Republican party there. Wouldn't that be true even if black voters could vote in other ways? In other words, reducing an opportunity is reducing an opportunity in the text of the statute even if there's still other avenues open to the black voters.
",0.4087951183319092
591,19-1257,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3236,3266," Okay. But isn't you know, we might disagree about that, but let's say that, you know, some of Justice Kagan's examples, which seemed on their face to be ostensibly neutral, on their face, time, place, and manner restrictions, if it takes one opportunity away, I guess I still don't understand why that isn't reducing the ability of those voters to vote, relative to other white voters that don't share that same burden.
",0.9719457626342773
592,19-1257,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3460,3496," Counsel, you're aware of what the Carter-Baker Commission found about ballot harvesting. They said that absentee ballots are the largest source of potential voter fraud. They said citizens who vote at home, at nursing homes, at the workplace or church are more susceptible to pressure or to intimidation and that they recommended that the practice of allowing candidates or party workers to pick up and deliver absentee ballots should be eliminated. You think that's you disagree with that in this case, right, given your --
",0.37288138270378113
593,19-1257,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3527,3554," So the the law is you would strike down because of there's not racial proportionality in in enforcing the law, and that means that your pursuit of racial proportionality would require you to keep in place the pressure, the intimidation that caused President Carter and Secretary Baker to recommend that that harvesting practice be eliminated?
",-0.41970697045326233
594,19-1257,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3611,3629," I understand your position, which is that if there isn't racial proportionality, then the the law should be struck down. I'm just asking you if that requires you to tolerate the difficulties and problems and pressures that President Carter and Secretary Baker outlined in their report.

595,19-1257,Clarence_Thomas_,3774,3807," You know, I often wonder when you when we say there's an additional burden, Arizona is a big state and it's quite rural. I'm sure there are some people in very rural parts of Arizona who are quite burdened by the distance they have to travel in order to vote. How do you compare someone who is supposedly burdened or allegedly burdened by the out-of-precinct policy to a person like that?
",0.009572143666446209
596,19-1257,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3851,3938," Well, I have two related questions, and both are about standards, which I think is the main issue here. What do you think of, since disparate impact is this is not the only field in which it comes up, that we take the standards from the other areas employment, age, and housing and so forth and simply say they're roughly the same here? The statute does speak on account of race, which means if it's justified, it's not on account of race, all right? So we simply take those standards, producing a uniformity in the law. That's my general question. My specific question is, what do you really say about the question that I think Justice Thomas was asking, that if you win in the details here, in many in the majority of states, they won't be able to engage in precinct voting, because a lot of the precincts will turn out to be maybe 10 feet or maybe 100 yards or maybe 1,000 yards on in general further away from a minority group of houses than a majority group of houses. Are you supposed to go out with a tape measure? What? All right. That's a concern in the specific case. So I'm interested in both. One, what's your general view of using roughly the same standards, and, two, what about that specific case?
",-0.2510654032230377
597,19-1257,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4039,4088," Counsel, I want to try to give you a couple of examples and ask you for each one to assume that a Title a Section 2 plaintiff is able to show statistical disparities that are at least as great as those that were shown here with respect to out-of-precinct precinct voting and that those disparities were cause for but-for caused by the same socioeconomic factors that you say were the but-for causes here. So the first example is a state that has the early voting period begin two weeks before Election Day and the plaintiffs say and they show that that has instead, it should have been 60 days, and there's the same kind of statistical disparities.
",-0.8560425043106079
598,19-1257,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4096,4116," They want to go they want to go from 14 to 60. A lot of minority voters are unable, they they they or they they don't vote within the 14-day period to the same extent as they would within the 60-day period.
",-0.3773477077484131
599,19-1257,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4144,4165," All right. How about a how about a rule the state has a rule that you have to you have to fill in a little box to vote for a candidate, but it can be shown that there's a statistical disparity with respect to voters who don't actually fill in the box, but they they make a checkmark beside the box.
",-0.9097653031349182
600,19-1257,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4194,4215," Well, I don't really see the difference between let me give you one more example. The state has a rule that says that mailed-in ballots have to be received within three days after Election Day, and the section a Section 2 plaintiff says it should be one week, and they showed the same kind of statistical disparities.
",-0.44657987356185913
601,19-1257,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4237,4267," Counsel, I'd like to return to a question that Justice Thomas asked not of you, I don't believe, but more generally, which is: how do you prove that a legislature acted with discriminatory intent, assuming, as we must, that the legislature is made up of individuals? And so, if you show only two or three of them have a discriminatory intent, how can you assume that the others do?
",-1.0094586610794067
602,19-1257,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4330,4350," just the Chief Justice pointed out that there are independent reasons for passing the ballot collection limitations. Did the district court actually look to determine that even if this was a motivating factor, that the law would not have passed without it?
",-1.0222350358963013
603,19-1257,Elena_Kagan_,4391,4499," Ms. Amunson, the longer this argument goes on, the less clear I am as to how the parties' standards differ. So, if I understood what Mr. Carvin said at argument, as opposed to what he said in his brief, he said, of course, you should look at demographic realities. He even said, you know, it would be laughable not to look at demographic realities on occasion. And I bring you back to this hypothetical question where black voters have many fewer polling stations, even though that's a completely neutral rule on its face, but the way it operates is to make voting more difficult for black voters than white voters and leave it so that they the political system is not equally open to their participation. And he said, sure, you can you can look at that. And, similarly, you talked about, like, the practical evaluation of realities on the ground. So, I mean, tell me how you think these things differ. And I guess, more specifically I guess, when you start thinking about a whole run of hypotheticals, there are some things that are really quite obvious burdens which you just know looking at them is going to lead to to real difficulty for some you know, to black for black voters or for Native American voters or for Latino voters, and then other restrictions where you can say, well, you know, that's kind of an inconvenience, but they could they could overcome that inconvenience if if they really wanted to. So how how is is is you know, I guess what I'm saying, that there's a spectrum of restrictions and a spectrum of the effects that those restrictions cause. How are we to think about that?
",0.6457627415657043
604,19-1257,Neil_Gorsuch_,4637,4662," Okay. So so let's let's take the harvesting one, for example. The you know, the district court found that there was evidence available. The Chief Justice has referred to the the Carter-Baker Commission, and there was also evidence, I believe, in the record of of harvesting affecting fraudulent practices, harvesting affecting at least one election elsewhere. What about that is insufficient?
",-0.3983215093612671
605,19-1257,Neil_Gorsuch_,4687,4702," Okay. So it doesn't matter then you you agree it doesn't matter that there harvesting hasn't resulted in fraud in Arizona. How many states, how many elections does it need to affect out out of state before Arizona can take cognizance of it in its own state?
",-0.2890763282775879
606,19-1257,Neil_Gorsuch_,4742,4760," counsel, I I guess it's I'm just asking a pretty simple question. You you you agree that some prophylactics are allowed and that this addresses a prophylactic issue that other states have found to be problematic and and a blue-ribbon commission found to be problematic. How much more evidence what more concretely would you require?
",-0.6764105558395386
607,19-1257,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4802,4952," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Ms. Amunson. I want to explore how we got here as a statutory matter and try to square up the statutory text and common sense a bit. It seems like there are two polar positions one could have reading different parts of the statute. So Section 2(a) speaks only of results. That was the House bill, of course. And that strongly supports a position that any disproportionate impact would be problematic under the statute. Of course, the Dole compromise meant that Section 2(b) was added to the statute, and that speaks of opportunity. And a polar position on that would be, as was suggested in Mr. Carvin's brief, that time, place, and manner restrictions that are race-neutral provide equal opportunity. But, as Justice Kagan pointed out, just Mr. Carvin alluded to demographic realities being relevant, the state attorney general also talked about the totality of the circumstances being relevant, and, of course, in Section 2(b) refers to the totality of the circumstances. So, to the extent we're not at either polar position, we're between pure results and pure opportunity, as defined in in Mr. Carvin's brief at least, and we're in totality of the circumstances, two two circumstances that seem to make a difference as a matter of common sense. One, as the Chief Justice pointed out, when you have the Carter-Baker Commission saying that a particular state law is a good idea as a matter of policy, that would seem to be a circumstance that is as a matter of common sense, would would lend support to the state's rule. And then, secondly, and I mentioned this earlier, when a state rule is commonplace in other states, that would seem to be a circumstance that puts a thumb on the scale in favor of the legitimacy of the state rule and it not being a reflection of discriminatory intent. And, here, the out-of-precinct policy is in something like 26 other states, including a wide variety of states, including states with no history of discrimination. So, if we get into totality of the circumstances, why don't those two things matter? And you can comment more generally on how I've outlined this.
",0.07607284188270569
608,19-1257,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5031,5114," Secretary Ms. let's see. Sorry, I got distracted by the run-on there. So, Ms. Amunson, I want to ask you a question about the degree of, say, inconvenience versus burden, because one of the difficulties in this case is that, you know, the attorney general says that the burden has to be substantial, Mr. Carvin's talking about the ordinary burdens of voting. And there's a difficulty that, you know, the statutory language and its lack of clarity presents in trying to figure out when something crosses from an inconvenience to a burden. You know, on the other side and I think some of the hypotheticals that Justice Alito was asking you emphasized this I think, you know, your position and its emphasis on any disparity at all risks saying that any election rule, you know, which, as Judge Easterbrook pointed out in his Frank opinion, you know, all election rules are going to make it easier for some to vote than others. So your approach risks ruling them all out. So let me give you an example. What about a rule that the polls close at 7 p.m. and because of socioeconomic reasons, it's harder for minority voters to get to the poll spot before 7 p.m. because of the time, you know, of their work hours in the day? Is that the kind of burden that triggers Section 2? Would that would such a rule poll closure rule, would that violate Section 2?
",0.08265414834022522
609,19-1257,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5138,5149," But I'm telling you it is, that because of socioeconomic conditions and the hours that minorities work, you know, that is the cause of their not being able to get to the polls during hours that the polls are open.
",0.5668846368789673
610,19-1257,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,5353,5393," Counsel, I want to touch on an issue that Justice Sotomayor raised with with your friend about legislative intent. Let's say that you have 49 legislators who speak and give good reasons for adopting, say, a law against ballot harvesting. They they quote the Carter-Baker Commission, 49 of the legislatures don't say anything, legislators don't say anything at all, and two legislators have a clear racial motivation. And the law passes 80 to 20. Was race a motivating factor in that case so that the legislation would be suspect?
",-0.5770794749259949
611,19-1257,Clarence_Thomas_,5497,5547," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, the again, the legislative intent is interesting, and I don't know how much weight we should put on it, but the the Ninth Circuit did put somewhat some weight on that. I'm wondering how you would analyze that if, in addition to what was said that was somewhat of a pejorative nature about minorities, if someone said the opposite or something similar or countervailing about whites, and you had both sets of pejoratives in the legislative history, how would you analyze that and how would it change the way you would analyze this case?
",-0.7861976027488708
612,19-1257,Stephen_G_Breyer_,5663,5724," Listen, because I I just appreciate your comments. You've listened to the same argument I have here, and it seems to me lots of the parties on both sides are pretty close on the standards. So you take the Title VII or these other title standards. You might have to modify it a little. I think you do have to use the word ""significant"" harm because you have to out you have to some way or other get rid of this happening just by chance. Maybe you'd say it was reasonably foreseeable that minorities would be impacted negatively. And there's room there for, who has the burden of proof of showing that there's a justification? And there's a question about the extent to which non-race-based tradition would count as a justification. Now any comments you want to make are welcome. Any additions to what I'm seeing as open areas or not, any comment?
",0.36638256907463074
613,19-1257,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,5786,5859," I I think what concerns me is that your position is going to make every voting rule vulnerable to attack under Section 2 to the same extent that the out-of-precinct policy is was found to to violate Section 2 by the Ninth Circuit, because people who are poor and less well educated on balance probably will find it more difficult to comply with just about every voting rule than do people who are more affluent and have had the benefit of more education. Explain to me why that is not so. Will it not be possible to show with respect to just about every voting rule that there is the kind of statistical disparity that was shown with respect to out-of-precinct voting and that the disparity was caused by the same socioeconomic factors that you would say were sufficient here?
",1.0306065082550049
614,19-1257,Sonia_Sotomayor_,5918,5972," Counsel, should there be a different burden between changing a long-established voting requirement and imposing a new one? Let's go back to the two questions the two practices at issue here. The out-of-precinct voting is not a new law. It's always been in effect. And so where is that fact considered in the totality of circumstances as you define it? And I have an easier time understanding how the ballot collection is a change in law and one in which the information provided to the legislature and the voters a lot of it was racially tinged and false, correct?
",-0.35663050413131714
615,19-1257,Elena_Kagan_,6089,6107," Mr. Spiva, you you you spoke with Justice Breyer about the Stephanopoulos test. I would like to ask you about the old SG test. If if you look at the SG brief that was filed in this case, what do you think is right with what the SG said and what do you think is wrong with it?
",-1.6480355262756348
616,19-1257,Neil_Gorsuch_,6244,6263," Well, the law sometimes uses proximate cause and other times it uses but-for cause. That was a Title VII case. This is obviously a Section 2 case. Any any thoughts on why a proximate cause test would be inappropriate given the language of the statute?
",-0.7207202315330505
617,19-1257,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,6346,6406," Good morning, counsel. Section 2's language is elusive in the wake of the Dole compromise, which created murkiness because it was a compromise that generated then overwhelming support in Congress and from President Reagan, but the statute after the Dole compromise, I think you agree, creates something of a gray area between a pure results and pure opportunity. And you look at the totality of the circumstances, several counsel have said, including, I think you said, the Senate factors. One of those factors is, is there a good justification for these rules? And then, on the ballot collection, I'm going to repeat the question, you have the Carter-Baker recommendation. On the out-of-precinct, you have it being commonplace in other states. That on its face, at least to me, suggests a strong justification for doing these rules. How does that weigh in the balance in your view?
",0.10307560861110687
618,19-1257,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,6494,6537," Mr. Spiva, I want to pick up where you left off with Justice Kavanaugh. You said there were a number of factors in Arizona that caused the out-of-precinct policy to discriminate on the basis of race, including, you know, the fact that Arizona changes its precincts often. Let's assume that we adopt a but-for standard of causation, as you propose. I want to ask you a question that Judge O'Scannlain raised in his dissent to the Ninth Circuit's en banc decision, which is why isn't it the precinct system itself rather than the policy of discounting votes that causes the disparity? Because, as you described it, it's the fact that the, you know, precincts change, the locations move around, but you've expressly disavowed any challenge to the precinct policy itself, am I right?
",-0.3226017951965332
619,19-1257,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,6557,6572," what causes them, as opposed to the ballot collection, where the argument is the inability to vote by relying on a third party actually reduces the opportunity to vote. Here, it's not the the discounting of the votes. It's the inability to locate and show up at the right precinct that causes the disparity, correct?
",-0.9869540333747864
620,20-440,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,139.9,183.83999995," Thank you, Mr. Hochman. I want to focus a little bit on your your policy argument that getting rid of assignor estoppel would help, you know, get rid rid of bad patents in encouraging inventors to to challenge particular claims. But I thought strong patents was the way we encourage invention and that assignor estoppel helped ensure the strength and stability of of those patents. How do you sort out those competing policy arguments?
",-0.8745144605636597
621,20-440,Clarence_Thomas_,323.76,359.195," Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, you said that the you could not compare assignor estoppel to issue concepts such as issue preclusion or claim preclusion, et cetera. You you distinguished them, but I don't think you demonstrated why those principles, which do not appear in the Patent Act, are applicable or acceptable, but assignor estoppel is not.
",-0.555995523929596
622,20-440,Clarence_Thomas_,421,447.81," Well, let's Petitioner here I'm really interested in clarification more than anything else on this point. But Petitioner here assigned a certain patent. There were changes to that, and I didn't quite get how much the patent was changed or continued. If you could help me on that, I'd appreciate it.
",-0.4512137770652771
623,20-440,Stephen_G_Breyer_,569.38,610.56," Thank you. Counsel, I've seen I assume that there's assume with me that there's quite a lot of precedent in favor of some form of the of the of the of the doctrine. Now you want to abolish it entirely, but we have many briefs that suggest not entirely but limited. Which set of limitations, in your opinion, would be the best? And, in particular, as the Chief asked, what's wrong with the limitations set forth by the government?
",-0.4807779788970947
624,20-440,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,744.52,788.6," Well, my fundamental question is, why is this a question for us and not a question for Congress? It's a question of statutory interpretation ultimately. There's precedent supporting the doctrine in some form. The Federal Circuit, which is the court that Congress created to deal with these issues, has worked out a body of precedent on it. There are policy arguments in both directions. There are potentially influential supporters of both sides of this argument. Why should we get into this? Would we not have to overrule some of our precedents to do what you ask?
",-0.23154394328594208
625,20-440,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,882.88,898.91," All right. One one other one other question if I can get it in. Can parties contract around this? Can an assignment specify whether the assignor can challenge the patent or not, or would that be against public policy in some sense?
",-1.6210787296295166
626,20-440,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1041.31,1072.08," But my next question for you is, going back to what Justice Alito started with, there may have been a period of of uncertainty between Lear and the Fed Circuit ruling in 1988 that estoppel was assignor estoppel was still being used. Given that Congress did a major overhaul of the Patent Act was it 20 --
",-1.1328035593032837
627,20-440,Elena_Kagan_,1142.395,1180.75000005," Mr. Hochman, I'd like you to assume with me, as you did for Justice Breyer, that there is a lot of precedent for some form of this doctrine, that Westinghouse called it a settled rule, that Scott Paper did nothing more than create an exception to it, and that Lear said that the equities were far more compelling for assignor estoppel than for the licensee estoppel that they eliminated. So let's just say it's a settled rule, and you need some special factor to justify overturning the doctrine under our stare decisis principles. What are your special factors?
",-0.538331151008606
628,20-440,Elena_Kagan_,1258.2,1295.105," Okay. Let me let me take you to a different place. Let's think about the core application of assignor estoppel, and I guess I want to know why it is that you don't think that this core application makes a lot of sense and accords with our basic principles of fairness. So let's say that an inventor invents something. She obtains a patent. She later sells the patent. And she then argues that the invention was completely obvious all the time and isn't patentable. So the question is, why is it fair to entertain that invalidity argument? It seems as though it's a total bait-and-switch.
",0.5839434266090393
629,20-440,Elena_Kagan_,1340.4,1356.15," ask you about another question, Mr. Hochman. So is there a meaningful difference between that case and a case where the inventor invents something, she swears an oath, she transfers the application before she receives a patent, and the final patent is exactly the same as the application?
",-1.7584244012832642
630,20-440,Neil_Gorsuch_,1375.775,1434.28," Let me come at the problem a different way. It it seems to me that we all agree that the common law would have had an equitable estoppel defense here available. And you don't contest that. The question is whether this Court should create something more on the basis of Formica and Scott Paper, which I understand the criticisms of. And the but the SG says we we can we can save the day, we can fix it. And it's going to be more than equitable estoppel, but it isn't going to be that much more. A arm's-length valuable consideration of materially identical claims. I want to know what I'm buying there. What what what I know how to apply equitable estoppel. What kinds of questions do you think will arise that this Court will have to address if we bless this new new revised and improved version of assignor estoppel?
",0.40239787101745605
631,20-440,Neil_Gorsuch_,1530.94,1571.12," So let let me interrupt you there, I'm sorry, just to see if I understand the the the the delta here. Most of these cases involve small inventors assigning patents to very large corporations and who are fully capable of examining the patent and may be in better position to identify its validity and who undoubtedly very rarely rely on these individuals. And if we get rid of material identity if we require material identically claims and get rid of reliance, we're we're really just advantaging the large inventors to the disadvantage of the the the sorry, the large purchasers to the disadvantage of the individual inventors.
",0.21610920131206512
632,20-440,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1598,1655.83," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Hochman. Your lead argument in the brief from pages 17 to 41 is to eliminate the doctrine of assignor estoppel, and I guess I want to pick up on Justice Kagan's questions on that. You have Chief Justice Taft, of course, in Westinghouse referring to the doctrine at that point in 1924 as well-settled since 1880, and it's continued without elimination since then. So what what is I'm not sure I heard exactly what is the special justification and particularly in a statutory case, where, as Justice Alito said, our our doctrine of stare decisis is especially strong. So why why get involved in overturning something that was well settled as of 1924?
",-0.2914196848869324
633,20-440,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1727.42,1764.815," Well, it went through I mean, I'm looking right at it. It went through a lot of the lower court cases and, you know, starts with 1880, and I guess I'm not sure about that, but let me ask you a different question. In the Respondents' brief, they say that assignor estoppel has engendered serious reliance interests, which is something we also have to think about, and they say I just want to get your reaction to for decades, millions of patents and applications have been assigned on the assumption that assignor estoppel bars assignors from later challenging the validity of the assigned patent rights. Just want to get your reaction to that.
",0.2566058039665222
634,20-440,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1806.24,1844.2," Mr. Hochman, I want to ask you about equitable estoppel. So how might equitable estoppel play out in this particular case? Let's say there's no assignor estoppel. You know, you have them alleging that Mr. Truckai had lied in his inventor's oath and then admitted that after the fact. And then you have this dispute about Claim 31 of his original application being nearly identical to Claim 1 of the later patent. So is there any way is it just about a lack of reliance interest? Or, if you assume that those allegations that your friends on the other side make are true, would there be any case for equitable estoppel here?
",-0.703001081943512
635,20-440,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1922.65,1968.16999995," So, you know, I think that the assignor estoppel doctrine, you know, as estoppel doctrines often do when they're thinking about fairness, you know, punishes a turncoat assignor, right, and there's something unseemly about representing to the person to whom you're assigning a patent, it doesn't cover this, you know, it's it's valid, and then turning around and and we all see the problem. You suggest that there can really be no reliance because people, especially sophisticated parties, as Justice Gorsuch suggests, are are doing their own investigation of the patent's validity. Is there any reason why the reliance incurred or why there would be reliance by the parties who are the assignees that could hurt them? I mean, you suggest that they're perfectly capable of analyzing the patents and they're not going to be, you know, led down the primrose path by the assignor.
",0.8491723537445068
636,20-440,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2192.435,2218.38," So the familiar process where a company hires an employee in a technical or whatever area and the employee signs over inventions that they may discover in the course of their employment to the employer, that would be or wouldn't be valuable consideration?
",-1.303468108177185
637,20-440,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2318.71,2398.21," Well, my question was really the same as the Chief's, if you want to say anything more about that. But I have a a second question, which I'll say what it is, is what I'm having trouble doing. I can understand abolishing it. I can understand keeping it. But limiting it, I'm finding trouble in finding the right way to do that. Why? Well, Smith invents a widget. He goes to another company, having assigned the widget to the first company, and the second company wants to go ahead and sell widget prime. The first company sues, and what they want to argue, perhaps like here, is, wait a minute, what we want to make has nothing to do with that patent. Oh, no, it does, go look at the claims. Well, it can't because, if it did include widget prime, the patent would be unlawful. So you see it can't. Well, says the Fed Circuit, you can't argue that; you're attacking your own patent. So I I think, my God, they're foisting this invention on the public forever and they can't argue even something like that and they can't even make widget prime? Do you see the problem?
",0.9526451230049133
638,20-440,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2546.095,2603.06," Counsel, Petitioner's counsel tried to do amendments to your proposal. Could you respond to those, number one? And, number two, am I clear that you're really not trying to return completely to Westinghouse because Westinghouse seemed to suggest that a court assignor estoppel would reach questions of overbroad claims, and you're not your test doesn't reach that at all, meaning you would just look, it seems, as to the time the claims as claimed at the time of assignment and those issued in the patent, and you don't even get to the question of whether or not Justice Breyer's question, whether or not that reading is overbroad.
",-0.2803192138671875
639,20-440,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2664.645,2701.475," Well, that somehow that, in my mind, gives credence to Petitioner's counsel that maybe the doctrine has lost its utility, because Westinghouse was really premised on a claim not dissimilar from this one, that if you read the claim in context, it would be overbroad to the description in the other claims. But you've just admitted that that things have gone have changed, how you read patents has fundamentally issued has fundamentally changed.
",0.2620270550251007
640,20-440,Elena_Kagan_,2719.995,2744.26," Ms. Ratner, you give three examples in your brief of places where you think, under your reformed doctrine, assignor estoppel wouldn't apply or might not apply. It's pre-invention assignments, continuation applications, and changes in the law. Is is is that it? Is that sort of an exclusive list, or do you have other to add to it?
",-1.46324622631073
641,20-440,Elena_Kagan_,2768.045,2818.02," Okay. Mr. Hochman said when I gave him what I considered to be the sort of paradigm cases of assignor estoppel and asked whether they should be estopped, he said yes, but they should be estopped under the equitable estoppel doctrine. And I take it what that would do for him is that it would impose a reliance requirement and that it would impose a sort of extra special affirmative, clear representation, so there could be nothing implicit about it, maybe he wouldn't rely on the oath. I'm making this up a little bit. But I guess the question is, what's the difference between equitable and assignor estoppel in your mind as to these paradigmatic cases, which we think of as bait-and-switch cases, and does that difference make a difference?
",-0.15770556032657623
642,20-440,Neil_Gorsuch_,2859.42,2962.995," Ms. Ratner, as I understand it, no court's ever applied the version of estoppel that you're proposing now. And so I I guess my first question is, why doesn't it face the same stare decisis challenges that the Petitioner has? So that's one set of questions for you. Second is, with respect to the the choice of relying on estoppel by deed and the analogy to physical property, it allows your test would allow liability even when there's no misrepresentation of fact and the buyer, often in these cases large and sophisticated, more so than the seller, could easily determine the validity of the patent on its own and is better positioned to do so. And you also get rid of reliance. And I guess I don't understand why we would impose liability on statements that even you'd agree were utterly meaningless at the time. And all that points to my third question, and then I'll stop, and that is, if we're going to look at estoppel doctrine, I I I guess I'm a little confused why we would look to real physical real estate as the example, where deeds, recorded deeds, have a special role in our in our system and have a special validity, rather than personal personal property, where these elements, misrepresentation of facts and and reliance, are required, given that patents are so easily killable and challengeable in ways that physical real estate, much harder to do so. So those are my three questions. Have at them in any order you want.
",0.5493617653846741
643,20-440,Neil_Gorsuch_,3007.4,3029.035," Yes. You're just saying you're getting rid of it in this area. You're not getting rid of it everywhere, I accept that, but you're getting rid of it here. And and I guess I'm just curious why why we would get rid of that and the material misrepresentation of fact in in this particular context and and why the analogy to to deeds and to real real property makes sense more than than personal property?
",0.5637409090995789
644,20-440,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3076.43,3114.03," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good afternoon, Ms. Ratner. I want to follow up on the three examples on page 20 of your brief that Justice Kagan was referencing and focus in particular on the first one and make sure I understand what you're saying exactly. The brief says, if an employee assigns to his employer all patent rights to any inventions he may develop in the course of his employment, the assignment generally would not imply any representation as to the patentability of particular inventions. And I want to know what you mean by the word ""generally"" or what's what's captured there and what's not captured there.
",-0.5562905669212341
645,20-440,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3208.43,3262.30999995," Good afternoon, Ms. Ratner. So I have a question about the choice that the choice that we're facing here. As Justice Breyer pointed out, you know, we can keep or let's just assume for the sake of this argument that I agree that stare decisis establishes that the assignor assignor doctrine exists. We have a choice between two bright-line rules, either we have it or we don't, or we can do this middle course that you're charting that, as you say, no court has applied before. It seems to me that your approach doesn't give us the efficiency of of estoppel doctrines generally. I mean, think about Blonder Tongue, patent context, and, you know, estoppel there, issue issue preclusion shuts it down and makes litigation more efficient. But, here, as I take it, your proposal would probably enmire the parties in fights about what's materially identical. I mean, would that be a battle of the experts?
",0.2055380791425705
646,20-440,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3521.99,3549.63," Mr. Wolf, you began by talking about stare decisis and cited some authority for it, but you have to weigh against that, don't you, the Court's description of assignor estoppel as a failure and the Court's statement that, to whatever extent that doctrine may be deemed to have survived the Formica decision or to be restricted by it, it's not controlling. So it's it's not the strongest stare decisis argument?
",-0.075655497610569
647,20-440,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3599.975,3621.63," I'd I'd like to see if there's a difference between your position and that of the Solicitor Solicitor General, in particular, for the person who enters employment and signs a general assignment of all her inventions to her employer. Does equitable or assignor estoppel apply in that case?
",-1.3279975652694702
648,20-440,Clarence_Thomas_,3673.355,3710.18," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, it seems as though your view of assignor estoppel begins to approach the assignments that one would require from an employee. It seems so how far would you go from the original assignment? Would you in this case, in the current case, the we're talking about a patent that is quite different from the original patent.
",-1.216732382774353
649,20-440,Clarence_Thomas_,3830.825,3855.505," But it seems as though you are you want Congress by statute to make changes to something that doesn't appear in the Patent Act. So I don't know how that's backwards to say, well, maybe Congress should amend the Patent Act to include assignor estoppel in the first instance?
",-0.21438711881637573
650,20-440,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3889.74,3993.145," How do you respond to what I've gotten out of some of the the briefs? There is precedent, it has problems, but 80 years old, 100 years old, what's changed? One, employment practices. So you've got general assignment. You go to work somewhere else and the new company is afraid to go anywhere near it. Second, nature of invention. Artificial intelligence, robots, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. Okay? Third, complexity. And complexity means this: Widget, patent, assigned to A. Go to work for B. B, widget prime. A sues B. All he wants to argue is, of course, the patent on widget doesn't cover widget prime because, if it did, then, since it wasn't described properly and couldn't be practiced by someone, there wasn't enough information, the patent would have been unlawful. Okay? No, says the Federal Circuit, you can't even argue that. Result, result, extension of many important patent monopolies which shouldn't be there and which, in fact, will cost the public the loan advances, and you can imagine that. All right. Now I may have overstated it. That's how I'm understanding it now. So they're saying do something. One side says there's nothing you can do except abolish it. Others say limit it. I want to hear your response.
",0.47268953919410706
651,20-440,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4096.52,4171.07," You're resisting any limitation to assignor estoppel, but as but there is a fairness element that you're not responding to, which is, if assignor estoppel isn't tethered in some way to the scope of the rights that were actually assigned, then I don't know why it's fair to estop an assignor from seeking to invalidate something that he or she did not actually assign. So, for example, if the original '072 application had only one claim that required moisture permeability but later you change, if Mr. Truckai assigned the patent that way and you revised it deleting that reference, why should Mr. Truckai be estopped? You did something that he didn't attest to, that wasn't within the claims specified. What sense does it make not to let him raise that defense?
",0.2983667850494385
652,20-440,Elena_Kagan_,4292.895,4332.15," Mr. Mr. Wolf, you just talked to Justice Sotomayor and before that to Justice Thomas about this case and and how we should understand things to have played out over time. But let's just assume a hypothetical case, and and I'm not meaning it to have any necessary relationship to yours. And the hypothetical is an inventor who assigns an application, and then the assignee broadens the patent claim beyond anything that the inventor would have thought patentable in the first instance. Why why should she be estopped?
",-0.35487106442451477
653,20-440,Elena_Kagan_,4367.26,4393.485," Right. Well, she could do that. I mean, I take the point, Mr. Wolf. She could do that. But but why should she be estopped under the assignor estoppel doctrine in any event, regardless of that alternative path? I mean, it it does seem as though the warranty that she made is not inconsistent with what she's doing now. And I would think that that's the critical question for for any estoppel doctrine.
",0.5005910396575928
654,20-440,Elena_Kagan_,4414.725,4438.11," Yeah, I didn't really mean to be making a 112 argument because I I just I think that this could be true under under 112 or not true under 112. I mean, the the the the point of my hypothetical was just to say that that something meaningful has happened between time one and time two with respect to the claim.
",0.24618738889694214
655,20-440,Neil_Gorsuch_,4487.02,4554.975," So, counsel, on the stare decisis front, I think I heard the SG's office acknowledge we're somewhere in between things. And as I come at it and tell me what's wrong with this Westinghouse didn't actually apply the doctrine. It acknowledged its existence and allowed the challenges over the scope of the of the patent. Scott Paper called it a logical embarrassment. Lear said that Scott had undermined the basis for patent estoppel even more than Westinghouse had. So it read Westinghouse as undermining the basis for patent estoppel. The world has changed greatly since then, as Justice Breyer pointed out, in terms of employee/employer relations and how these contracts of adhesions are often used against employees. And now we have the Patent Office itself refusing to apply patent estoppel in its own proceedings, for in IPR proceedings. So the only place left that this doctrine seems to apply is in court. Isn't that a strange state of affairs to to rest on stare decisis?
",0.803299605846405
656,20-440,Neil_Gorsuch_,4596.34,4655.425," So so so we got that. And then, if we're going to monkey with it, if we're going to change it, the Solicitor General says we should analogize to patents by deed sorry, estoppel by deed, which has to do with real estate, and it said it only did that because that's kind of what Westinghouse talked about. Why wouldn't the more natural place to look at is is is just plain old estoppel with respect to personal property, rather than real estate transactions, given that, if you look at estoppel by deed, there's no need for material misrepresentations. There's no need for reliance. And this would be this seemingly would be an area in which those would be very critical considerations when a large purchaser is taking a property off of a smaller inventor, someone who's well positioned to see whether there are any problems with the patent and who may not rely on a stray misstatement or puffery.

The Solicitor General wants to retain the doctrine of assignor estoppel but to limit it, and I want to make sure I understand your concerns about the SG's position. What what how would you describe your differences with the Solicitor General's position as articulated in the brief and today?

658,20-440,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4839.1,4873.065," Mr. Wolf, do you see this case as one about the reenactment canon where we would say there was a settled interpretation of an act and then Congress reenacted the statute without touching it and, therefore, you know, we assume that Congress intended to ratify it or Congress acquiesced in it, or do you see this as a case in which there was a settled common law background assumption, this assignor estoppel, and Congress took the soil of the common law with it into the Act, and does it matter which way you see it?
",-1.0106298923492432
659,20-440,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4876.13,4894.425," Well, I I guess I think it might matter because the reenactment canon requires a pretty well-established line of cases that would put Congress on notice. And as, you know, we've talked about a lot this morning, there's uncertainty in the cases, especially ours.

660,20-440,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4926.43,4940.375," But, counsel, when there's the the the language and, you know, this has come up already I mean, when you have the language in Scott Paper and then in Lear saying that Scott Paper undermined any basis for assignor estoppel, I mean, you can't say that it was completely embraced.
",0.19591191411018372
661,20-440,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4990.55,5023.99," Well, we've we've been very clear that, to the extent let's assume that Formica/Westinghouse did lay down a rule, although there's some dispute about whether it did that. Let's assume that it did. Let's assume that Scott Paper undercut it. We've been very clear in telling lower courts that, even if our precedents have made made it a virtual certainty that we would we would overrule it, that that's our prerogative. So the fact that lower courts continued to apply it wouldn't necessarily mean that, as we would view it, that it wasn't a dead letter. But my my time is up. Thank you.

662,19-416,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,140.985,171.655," Mr. Katyal, in this case, no foreign country has objected to the United States hailing its own citizens into its own courts. And why should we be cautious in terms of international relations in such a case? And what objection would foreign countries have to ensuring that U.S. corporations follow customary international law?
",-0.6588148474693298
663,19-416,Clarence_Thomas_,312.69,335.98," The what about the petition, the Respondents here say that even though there may not be an international norm or a universal norm on corporate liability, that that's different in the case of slavery slavery? What's your response to that?
",-1.6740473508834839
664,19-416,Stephen_G_Breyer_,400.885,463.715," Let me go back to the corporate liability. One of the three incidents that led to the statute, I take it, was the Marbois affair of 1784, and there was a French adventurer who assaulted the Secretary of the French Legion in Philadelphia and there was no legal remedy for the assault. Now that's so, isn't it? But this statute was designed, in part, to give a remedy. But suppose instead of, I think Mr. Marbois, I'm not certain if he which which of the parties he is, but suppose instead of him going up and hitting the French Secretary, he had been the president of a corporation and they all sat around and said: I have a great idea. Let's hit the French Secretary. So they pass a resolution and went out and hit the French Secretary. Why should that make a difference?
",0.5104689002037048
665,19-416,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,564.68,609.3," Mr. Katyal, many of your arguments lead to results that are pretty hard to take. So suppose a U.S. corporation makes a big show of supporting every cause de jure but then surreptitiously hires agents in Africa to kidnap children and keep them in bondage on a plantation so that the corporation can buy cocoa or coffee or some other agricultural product at bargain prices. You would say that the victims who couldn't possibly get any recovery in the courts of the country where they had been held should be thrown out of court in the United States, where this corporation is headquartered and does business?
",0.0749673917889595
666,19-416,Sonia_Sotomayor_,726.95000005,841.49," Counsel, as I listen to you, I and your answers to Justice Alito's questions, it seems to me that his hypothetical all pointed to the fact that the aiding and abetting by the corporation happened in the United States. That's that's a serious question here about whether there were enough allegations that the acts of this corporation had a sufficient tie to the United States. I put that argument aside. But we know that under the ATS the first Congress wanted the ATS to cover piracy. We also know that those who provided assistance to pirates were themselves held liable, whether they committed it on land or the sea, as aiders and abetters. And it boggles my mind to think that the aiding and abetting had to have happened on the sea and not on the land because the first the 1799 imposed criminal liability for wherever the assistance occurred. And so my difficulty is, in understanding your answer, why it is that the ATS would not have seen aiding and abetting as its own form of criminal liability and the issue being whether there were enough ties to the jurisdiction in which it occurred. I take I'm not I don't need an answer from you that says to me there wasn't enough here. I need an answer that says, why wouldn't the framers have seen aiding and abetting in this way?
",0.7341405153274536
667,19-416,Elena_Kagan_,983.27,1003.06," I I I guess what I'm asking is, like, what sense does this make? This goes back to Justice Breyer's question. What sense does this make? You have a suit against 10 slaveholders, 10 slaveholders decide to form a corporation specifically to remove liability from themselves, and now you're saying you can't sue the corporation?

668,19-416,Neil_Gorsuch_,1061.88,1112.515," Good morning, Mr. Katyal. I I'd actually like to pick up on on this line of questioning. I don't see anything in the language of the statute and I don't believe you've pointed to anything that distinguishes between individuals and corporations. And the rationale which Justice Breyer was alluding to for the ATS I think that we've said many times is to ensure that the United States provides a mechanism for aliens to remedy wrongs that would otherwise be held against the United States itself and perhaps be lawful causes for war against the United States. And on on on those two lines, on the language and on the rationale that this Court has long adopted, or recognized for the ATS, why would we exempt corporations?
",-0.33911409974098206
669,19-416,Neil_Gorsuch_,1155.75,1186.7," I don't believe you okay. I I I I understand your responses there. I don't believe you did get a chance to fully respond to Justice Kagan on their last point. I would like an answer to that. And that is we do know one thing about the ATS, is that it did permit in rem jurisdiction against things, in particular, pirate ships. If in rem jurisdiction was part of the ATS's contemplation, why wouldn't corporate liability, which then didn't exist, I mean, in serious in widespread form, but why wouldn't the same concept apply?
",0.7368385195732117
670,19-416,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1207.075,1242.81," Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Katyal. The Alien Tort Statute was once an engine of international human rights protection. Your position, however, would allow suits by aliens only against individuals, as you've said, and only for torts international law recognized that occurred in the United States. And Professor Koh's amicus brief on behalf of former government officials, for example, says that your position would ""gut the statute."" So why should we do that?
",0.12400945276021957
671,19-416,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1303.3,1321.475," Mr. Katyal, a lot of the questions you've been asked thus far focus on whether there's a specific universal and obligatory norm here. And that, you know, as many of my colleagues have pointed out, raises some complications. Do you agree that this is a case that would be better resolved at Sosa step 2?
",-1.1825141906738281
672,19-416,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1363.87,1390.905," Well, if we do resolve it at Sosa step 2, when would we ever recognize a cause of action? Because, you know, most cases will raise the same let's focus on the separation of powers prong. Most cases raise this question of the intricate policy questions that may be better left to Congress. I mean, we've been very restrained in the Bivens context about recognizing more causes of action. I mean, would this just kind of halt recognition of new causes of action altogether if we adopt your position?
",0.24323560297489166
673,19-416,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1565.26,1597.745," Counsel, I want to ask you the same question I asked Mr. Katyal. We don't have objections from foreign countries in this case. As far as we can tell, they're perfectly comfortable having U.S. citizens, U.S. corporations hailed into their U in U.S. courts. What should we make of that, and doesn't that suggest we ought to be a little more a little less cautious about finding a cause of action here?
",-0.5811678767204285

",-1.5478237867355347
675,19-416,Clarence_Thomas_,1695.43,1751.425," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, the I'm intrigued by my colleagues' questions on the corporate form and the but and I seem to remember that in the past the government has argued that the corporate form shouldn't make that difference as the difference in a case. And it's certainly not quite the argument or maybe even opposite argument that you're making now. I'd like you to if you can, to respond to some of the concerns raised by my colleagues with respect to the corporate form and to at least explain or correct me if I'm wrong about your prior positions, the government's prior positions, as to the coverage of the corporate form.
",-0.0762895792722702
676,19-416,Stephen_G_Breyer_,1854.395,1915.12," I'd like to hear, if you would, the government's answer to the same question that I think Justice Thomas everybody's been asking, use Justice Kagan's example if you want or my example, what's new about suing corporations? When I looked it up once, there were 180 ATS lawsuits against corporations. Most of them lost but on other grounds. So why not sue a domestic corporation? You can't sue the individual because, in my hypothetical, the individuals have all moved to Lithuania. All you have is the corporate assets in the bank and minutes that prove it was a corporate decision. What's new about it? Why is it creating a form of action? What's the reason it shouldn't be there? I mean I I don't see is it a different rule again for partnerships? Different rule again for, I don't know, limited liability companies or I mean, there are many forms of doing business. Why?
",0.15416142344474792
677,19-416,Stephen_G_Breyer_,1926.67,1945.2," Then you missed my question unless you're going to answer it there. What's extending it? As I said, there have been there are suits abroad. I think I've seen citations to them. And suits, many tens, hundreds perhaps, 200, 180, brought against corporations under the ATS.
",-0.1357385516166687
678,19-416,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2081.25,2118.585," Won't your arguments about aiding and abetting and extraterritoriality all lead to essentially the same result as holding that a domestic corporation cannot be sued under the ATS? Corporations always act through natural persons, so if a corporation can't aid and abet, there there will be only a sliver of activity where they could be responsible under respondeat superior, isn't that true?
",0.02469455450773239
679,19-416,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2177.87,2255.98," Counsel, I I'm I think I'm reading your brief right, that you don't think there's an aiding and abetting liability at all under international law. But both Blackstone and the first Congress recognized that facilitating piracy was a crime, and this Court reaffirmed that in nine 1795 in the Talbot case. Post-World War II, military tribunals held individuals liable for assisting the German government's war crimes. The international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda, the Special Court for Sierra Leone all have imposed aiding and abetting liability. So I'm having a very hard time accepting that if an individual aided and abetted in the United States or anywhere else that we couldn't hold that individual liable. Could you explain to me why I'm going to set aside the corporate for a moment. Could you set aside for me why you think international law there's not an international law against aiding and abetting something as heinous as child slavery?
",0.40159761905670166
680,19-416,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2298.965,2378.11," It doesn't make sense to me it might make sense to me in accordance with our rule in Jesner that we shouldn't hold corporations liable for foreign corporations liable for conduct that they conduct in foreign countries. I see all of the foreign and domestic conflicts that could occur there. I do not see the same conflict with holding an American corporation liable for the acts for acts it commits here, putting aside that the allegations and their sufficiency in this case, taking the hypothetical that Justice Alito set forth where most of the conduct was aiding and abetting conduct occurred here, it just I do not understand why international law would not have seen that as proper exercise of our power to say that our domestic corporations cannot aid and abet in the United States and be held liable under the ATS.
",1.1204379796981812
681,19-416,Elena_Kagan_,2399.64,2427.865," Mr. Gannon, one of the amicus briefs in this case says that many of the countries around the world with the strongest rule of law systems do hold their own corporations civilly liable for the kinds of actions at issue here. And the amicus brief says that's true of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Canada. Do you know of anything that suggests otherwise?
",-1.138444423675537
682,19-416,Elena_Kagan_,2450.29,2498.17500005," I guess the point I'm making here, Mr. Gannon, is you know, the Chief Justice started out by saying that other countries have not objected here. And that's true, but one might make a broader point, that the first Congress enacted the ATS in response to its concerns about other nations being offended by our failure to remedy international law violations. And one might ask why one would think that another country would be less offended by leaving a foreign victim without a remedy when that victim is injured by a U.S. corporation rather than by a U.S. a U.S. individual and, indeed, that most of the countries around the world with which we're usually associated as a rule of law nation do not make that distinction.

683,19-416,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2544.5,2574.52," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Gannon. Footnote 21 in Sosa instructs the courts to pay attention or give serious weight to the executive branch's view of the case's impact on foreign policy. In your view, are you does this case have an impact on foreign policy, or are you making a more general argument about the ATS?
",-1.269605278968811
684,19-416,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2644.815,2690.61," Counsel, I have a question about aiding and abetting liability and extraterritoriality. You say that the focus of the tort should be the primary conduct, so, here, what was happening in Cote d'Ivoire, rather than the aiding and abetting, which you characterize as secondary. But why should that be so? I mean, let's imagine you have a U.S. corporation or even a U.S. individual that is making plans to facilitate the use of child slaves, you know, making phone calls, sending money specifically for that purpose, writing e-mails to that effect. Why isn't that conduct that occurs in the United States something that touches and concerns, you know, or should be the focus of conduct, however you want to state the test?
",-0.14130869507789612
685,19-416,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2937.01,2976.49999995," Counsel, this case, of course, involves United States citizens and United States courts. But, in the context of that action, much of the focus is going to be on conduct overseas, and those responsible for that can be brought into court either as witnesses or for aiding and abetting. So why doesn't this type of action present the same international relations concerns that we've noted in in the prior cases in this area?
",-0.75652676820755
686,19-416,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3048.9,3087.76," The the TVPRA that you just mentioned, I think, is is pertinent here. Congress is addressing the sort of questions that you would have the Court resolve as a matter of, I suppose, federal common law. And doesn't what Congress did in the TVPRA suggest that they are cognizant of these questions, they are active in the area, and it's it's time for the Court to get out of the unusual situation where it's it's making rather than just interpreting law?
",-0.4620233178138733
687,19-416,Clarence_Thomas_,3157.96,3191.42999995," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. But the but the TVPA seems to suggest that Congress does not see the ATS the way you do. Obviously, there, you don't have corporate liability and you don't have aiding and abetting liability. So why shouldn't we take that as an indication that Congress sought limitations on on the ATS jurisdiction?
",-0.15104173123836517
688,19-416,Clarence_Thomas_,3259.5,3283.35000005," Are you just as a matter of curiosity, you bring this under the ATS, but could you have brought the same cause of action or a similar cause of action under different provisions or a different law or the I'm I'm just thinking of whether or not you could this could have been in diversity or something else.
",-0.7867012619972229
689,19-416,Clarence_Thomas_,3307.045,3334.66," On a separate matter, there seems to be some suggestion in the arguments, the in some of the other arguments that there's no new even though there's no universal norm for aiding and abetting in the civil context, it may well be in the criminal context. What's your reaction to that?
",-0.7972267866134644
690,19-416,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3395.1,3477.13999995," I'd like your views on the following: Assume that there is corporate liability for domestic corporations. Assume that there is aiding and abetting liability. Now what counts as aiding and abetting for purposes of this statute? When I read through your complaint, it seemed to me that all or virtually all of your complaints amount to doing business with these people. They help pay for the farm. And that's about it. And they knowingly do it. Well, unfortunately, child labor, it's terrible, but it exists throughout the world in many, many places. And if we take this as the norm, particularly when Congress is now working in the area, that will mean throughout the world this is the norm. And I don't know, but I have concern that treating this allegation, the six that you make here, as aiding and abetting falling within that term for purposes of this statute, if other nations do the same, and we do the same, could have very, very significant effects. I'm just saying I'm worried about that. And I I want you to explain to me how this should work.
",1.1112112998962402
691,19-416,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3606.36,3673.095," Mr. Hoffman, I'm interested in what your complaint alleges about the mens rea of these particular defendants regarding forced child labor. You've had 15 years now to refine your complaint, and I assume you've chosen your words with care. In paragraph 50 on page 319 of the Joint Appendix, you allege that ""Defendants"" in general ""not only purchased cocoa from farms and/or farm cooperatives which they knew or should have known relied on forced child labor."" So even putting aside the question of which defendants you're referring to, you don't even allege that they actually knew about forced child labor. Do you go further any place in the complaint? And, if not, is ""should have known,"" which is basically recklessness, enough for aiding and abetting liability under either international law or U.S. law?
",0.06015782058238983
692,19-416,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3780.88,3817.14500005," See now, this is an important point, and this is something you have to allege even under notice pleading. And I assume you're really careful you were careful about what you alleged because you don't want to incur Rule Rule 11 liability. So, after 15 years, is it too much to ask that you allege specifically that the the defendants involved the defendants who are before us here specifically knew that forced child labor was being used on the farms or farm cooperatives with which they did business? Is that too much to ask?
",0.27209019660949707
693,19-416,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3887.425,3924.94999995," Your complaint, as I see it, alleges that there was some decision-making in the United States to buy these products from these kinds of farms. I presume that's knowing that they're child labor. But I don't see an allegation other than sending representatives to look at the farms so that knowledge could be imputed that there's any other actual acts of aiding and abetting that you have alleged against the particular U.S. corporations that you're suing.

694,19-416,Elena_Kagan_,4088.705,4125.135," Mr. Mr. Hoffman, on the question of corporate domestic liability, the government makes the argument that Jesner changed everything. It originally took the same position that you're taking now on corporate domestic liability. It said that that position is now untenable, that once the Court held that foreign corporations weren't liable, the Court really can't hold that domestic corporations are. What what is your response to that?
",-1.2280174493789673
695,19-416,Elena_Kagan_,4235.845,4263.99," But, you know, as you note, Jesner is a is a fractured decision. There's a majority in some places, only a plurality in other places. If you look at that decision, what do you think it tells us about the approach that we need to use to answer the question of domestic corporate liability for child slavery? I mean, what is controlling, do you think, with respect to how we go about answering that question?
",-0.7602564692497253
696,19-416,Neil_Gorsuch_,4362.46,4450.63," And and, here, you're asking us to infer a new cause of action for aiding and abetting. And I guess I want to understand why I should be creating new causes of action as a Judge today. We have abandoned federal common law in every other area after Erie, or at least we proclaim to do so. And I'm not sure I understand why the ATS should be different, especially when Congress stands able and ready to create new causes of action, as the Chief Justice has pointed out it's done elsewhere. That would be the appropriate more appropriate place to create new legislation, it would seem, and in every respect, what you're asking us to do is a form of legislation. And then finally I throw into the mix Central Bank, which underscores that aiding and abetting liability is a different thing and that often there are good reasons not to have aiding and abetting liability even when there's primary liability. So whatever I think about the question, I have to at least acknowledge there are good arguments for a lawmaker to consider on both sides of that question, which, again, takes me back to my question wondering whether I'm the right person to be making this pitch to rather than a legislator. Can you help me with that?
",0.3150530457496643
697,19-416,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4603.74,4733.735," I have a different flavor of Justice Gorsuch's broader question about separation of powers. And this case really is a case, I think, about the proper role of the judiciary as compared to the proper role of Congress here in fleshing out the Alien Tort Statute. As you know, Sosa and Jesner and our other cases have said the court the courts should not be out in front in fleshing out the cause of action here. It didn't go it didn't reject it entirely. It didn't take Justice Scalia's position, but it shouldn't be out in front. And two sources in particular the Court has said to look to to constrain the cause of action to make sure, as Justice Gorsuch said, we're not creating it ourselves, and one is, of course, making sure the norm is sufficiently rooted in international law, as you know. And my concern on that is the language of Sosa doesn't just talk about the norm, as you know, but Footnote 20 specifically directs us to look at the particular perpetrator being sued and the category of perpetrator, whether it's a corporation or individual. And I've looked at this before, as you know, and looked at it again, and I think it's hard to argue that corporate liability in international law is a specific universal and obligatory or specific and universal. Foreign law is different. Justice Kagan rightly points that out. And there may be debatable policy reasons for drawing a line between individual and corporate liability, but it's but it's hard to argue that it's there in international law. That's my concern in this case, stems on the question presented on corporate liability stems from Footnote 20 and the content, as I see it, of international law. So I'll give you an opportunity to respond to that.
",0.6011159420013428
698,19-416,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4775.07,4793.375," That's a I think that's a different question, though, and that gets to Justice Kagan's point, which I think is a good one, that foreign foreign law does impose corporate liability, of course, as does U.S. law in many circumstances, but international law and the international tribunals have not seemed to do so.
",-0.09542235732078552
699,19-416,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4831.695,4844.915," Well, except then the second constraint that the Court has said to look to, of course, is Congress. And you don't see it in the things like the TVPA. You've responded to that, though. And my time's up, so I'll let let it go there.

700,19-416,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4848.37,4897.175," Counsel, in response to a question by Justice Kagan, you said that the ATS was a statement by the First Congress that we will enforce the law of nations and provide a forum for foreign citizens to do that. But, of course, the ATS also did it to protect the you know, the the policy interests of the United States and to protect the United States from retaliation by other countries in circumstances in which it failed to provide such a forum. So we've talked a little bit about the foreign policy implications or lack thereof of our recognizing a cause of action against domestic corporations for violations of international law norms, but could you say a little bit about any foreign policy implications that might be the result of our failing to recognize such a cause of action?

So Mr. Katyal was pointing out that domestic corporations often have relationships with foreign subsidiaries or parent corporations and, therefore, that many of the same concerns that we identified in Jesner would be implicated by the recognition of liability in this context as well. So what do you have to say to that? Would recognizing liability here against a domestic corporation with foreign foreign relatives just permit an end run around Jesner?

702,18-540,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,129.79,178.31000005," Counsel, your basic point, it seems to me, is that the law regulates drug prices. That's certainly the the purpose of it. But it doesn't say anything about drug prices. Instead, it talks about what plans have to pay for benefits, the methodology of determining the amount to be paid, the timing and procedures for updating payment schedules, the dispute resolution processes, remedies. It has things like the authorizing, declining to dispense. I I mean, at the end of the day, all this might have an impact on drug prices, but it seems to me that it's very different, and those differences really do go to what ERISA is trying to regulate.

And that seems that there's then it determines when the copay is determination is made final.

Today, when we interpret statutes, what we generally do is to ask what they would have been under what what the language would have been understood to mean at the time of enactment, and we have moved away from interpreting statutes in light of the purposes that they are thought to serve.

What I am interested in is a a different scenario than this law, but, if we if we rule in your favor, I'm not sure what the distinguishing factor might be between this law and between your law and the hypothetical I'm going to pose. Let's say a state decides we're going to have three tiers of drug of drugs. For Tier A, the plan is everybody's going to pay all PBMs are going to pay $100; for Tier B drugs, $200; and for Tier C drugs, $1,000. And let's say a plan or let's say just about every plan decides that the price of Tier C drugs was so high that the plan simply could not afford to provide those drugs to its participants. That is affecting the beneficiaries and what they get. And it's affecting, at least for those who who are not on fixed co-pays but on percentage co-pays your fixed ones, I'm assuming, is when you pay 5, 10, 15, or $20 for each drug, as opposed to one that says, we'll pay 80 percent and you pay 20. Beneficiaries are being directly affected and plans are being affected quite directly because they're being blocked out of of any market whatsoever for a cheaper drug. Why wouldn't that second scenario be preempted?

The SG spends a good deal of time talking about the distinction between regulating PBMs and regulating plans. So, if the plan managed prescription drug benefits itself, the SG says that would be a different question and we shouldn't reach that question. I had thought that your argument really made that distinction irrelevant. But, when you spoke when you answered the Chief's question, you said, well, our law is directed to PBMs, not plans. So I guess what I want to ask you is, were we to rule in your favor, should we write an opinion that really makes that critical, or should we write an opinion that that makes it essentially irrelevant?

Much of your brief focuses on the fact that the regulation here is directed to a third party rather than a plan.

And, here, we have 45 different states that have passed all kinds of laws with respect to these PBMs. And I'm wondering why that doesn't raise exactly the specter that the drafters of ERISA were concerned about, where the PBMs, you know, are trying to do 45 different things in 45 different states in a in a in a way that really does affect plan administration.

And I think, when you zoom out, that statement suggests something's gone awry here in the jurisprudence because costs will directly affect the benefits paid to beneficiaries, and the goal of ERISA, after all, was to protect American workers, including, it would seem, against state regulation that would perhaps favor state businesses over state workers. So why shouldn't ERISA care about costs that are going to be increased and thereby passed on in the form of lower benefits or worse benefits to, here, Arkansas workers?

Everything does relate to everyone everything else. So what kind of ""relate to""? And, obviously, the Court's struggled with that. What about a state setting prices, high prices or low prices, of hospital services, of pencils, of orange juice? They all relate to cost. So we got out of that one by saying: Well, even the hospital services, even that, just raising prices isn't a close enough relation. Hmm, that's interesting. Now you put that on you've taken an aspect of that. You said, well, no, it's the procedures that you use in order to decide what the prices are that's the problem. But every form of rate regulation involves procedures. They all do. And, therefore, we're going to get into the same business. How much procedure is too much? How much is too little? What kind of procedures? Wouldn't it be simpler to read that word ""relate to"" that we'd have to go back on language and say what it means is ordinary principles of preemption. They're complicated enough. But, I mean, my goodness, to add a special group of words over in the ERISA section just makes life much more complex.

And it requires, I'm sure, pretty complicated computer programs, and and that's why, apparently, there are so few of these PBMs. It requires a pretty sophisticated entity to deal with this situation at all. So, in light of that, why would it be so difficult and costly and burdensome for the PBMs to deal with a variety of different state laws?

And they say, basically, if you look at our cases, in particular Travelers, we have made that distinction time and time again, that the reimbursement process is a process that involves the relationship between the plan and the provider, and ERISA preemption doesn't care about that. The only thing ERISA preemption cares about is the relationship between the plan and the beneficiary, such as in the claims processing sphere. So why isn't that the way to look at this?

And it's clear to me that genocidal acts of taking property, even from non-nationals from from nationals would be an act of genocide. I think that's clear from the Clarification Act today.

""Rights"" and ""property"" mean the same thing. And then you have, you know, ""taken in violation of international law."" I understood you to concede the point that property can be taken in as as as as part of, as an important element of genocide, so that property can be taken in in violation of international law.

And Judge Katsas pointed out in his dissent from denial of rehearing en banc that in the context of the kinds of claims that the plaintiffs asserted here, that the scheme they propose oddly matches the jurisdictional equivalent of a thermonuclear weapon, determining the scope of genocide, to the merits equivalent of swatting a fly, which is looking at the underlying merits, determining whether there was a common law conversion. Would in the private context that that everybody agrees could go forward under the international law of takings if this were a suit brought by foreign nationals, would that involve the court in the same kind of quagmire that Judge Katsas is identifying here, having to determine the scope of a genocide, or does resort to the international law of takings give the court a clean way of deciding it without having to get into the human rights aspect?

750,19-351,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1992.215,2026.885," Counsel, to what extent have other nations created or done away with sovereign immunity for takings either from nationals or non-nationals? Meaning the U.S. has done it, you claim, for takings involving non-nationals, but how many other countries have done the same thing, waived sovereign immunity in those situations automatically?
",-1.2521735429763794
751,19-351,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2044.96,2088.43499995," Well, I guess I guess, if up to me I'm sorry for interrupting you, but we are on limited time if we're already an exception to the rule, I don't see then why we have to read the exception to the rule what the principles that would guide us with respect to the U.S.'s self-interest, why we shouldn't just read the plain text of the law and import into it the limitations of customary international law when customary international law, frankly, doesn't waive sovereign immunity at all?

752,19-351,Elena_Kagan_,2159.645,2189.995," Mr. Kneedler, I take your point that Congress probably wasn't thinking about this case when it passed (a)(3), but but that's not always what we consider most relevant. I mean, what is your best evidence that this language that is used in (a)(3) is a term of art with a specialized meaning, as opposed to ordinary language that should be read in an ordinary way to comprehend these claims, whether or not Congress thought about the question at the time?
",-0.4228205978870392
753,19-351,Elena_Kagan_,2238.01,2264.61," I mean, it's true that you have the word ""taken,"" but, in in in fact, you don't even have the word ""taking"" or or ""confiscation"" in the way that you have in the Hickenlooper Act. And the Restatement, which some people have pointed to, you know, also uses the word ""taking"" and makes it very clear that it the word ""alien"" is all over the Restatement. So, if I'm just looking at this language, ""taken"" itself, I say, well, this language covers these claims.

754,19-351,Neil_Gorsuch_,2297.37,2337.04," Good morning, Mr. Kneedler. I I understand your argument that the Clarification Act only works to address limits on the commercial activity requirement. But (h)(2) does exempt Nazi-era claims, and where the action is ""based on a claim that such work was taken in connection with the acts of a foreign government as part of a systematic campaign of coercive confiscation or misappropriation of works from members of a targeted and vulnerable group."" Doesn't that seem to anticipate that there will be such claims that can be brought under (a)(3)?
",-0.11576343327760696
755,19-351,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2433.5,2463.265," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Kneedler. You've explained what you think the statutory phrase means, but I just want to explore the rationale behind the distinction. So what, in your view, is the justification for denying compensation to citizens of the country in question or, maybe stated the other way, what harms would result from recognizing claims that outweigh the benefits of recognizing the claims?
",-1.0881291627883911
756,19-351,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2571.445,2627.97," Mr. Kneedler, I have a question about what the Clarification Act should tell us about the expropriation exception. So, in showing special solicitude for Nazi-era claims, the Clarification Act clearly assumes that some such claims against Nazi-era confiscations of property would be going forward and that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act would not bar them. So, if your interpretation of the expropriation exception is correct to say that it applies only when there's a foreign national suing a government for the taking of property, what kind of class of claims are those? I guess that would open up some of the difficult questions of nationality and citizenship that Justice Alito was asking you, but could we expect there would have been or was there a large subset of claims brought against Nazi governments Nazi-controlled governments by foreign nationals? What what is Congress referring to there?
",-0.7074404954910278
757,19-351,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3032.29,3068.61," Well, obviously, there's no issue in this case, but how do you decide in in other instances whether or not the taking is in the context of more general violations of human rights so that you call fall within this in other words, how broadly would you articulate the if you want to call it the genocide exception to the normal rule? Now, of course, the first answer is, you know, whatever it is, it covers this case, but do you have a more general rule that would be applied in other situations?
",-0.8568393588066101
758,19-351,Clarence_Thomas_,3136.545,3175.385," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, can you give me any any example of genocide where property has not been involved? It seems like, as I think of whether it's Armenia or the Ukraine or Germany or up in the Baltic States, that whenever that's occurred there's been a loss of property or a taking of property. So wouldn't virtually every one of those involved be covered by your argument?
",-0.6779342889785767
759,19-351,Clarence_Thomas_,3212.47,3248.605," Well, I don't understand how it would make a difference to have one sequence versus the other, that you commit the genocide before you take the property or the property before you take the the before you commit the genocide. But, with that aside, we've said, I think, in other cases that the expropriation exception was not a radical departure. Wouldn't your reading it as you do be just that, a radical departure?
",0.6155931353569031
760,19-351,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3393.49,3506.88," It seems to me that you could read this language to refer to what was expropriation: that was the Communists, that was Nasser, that was sometimes in South America, Venezuela, et cetera. And they're talking about expropriation. And the other way would be to read it, as you read it, they're just talking about property involved in a violation of international law. And, as Justice Thomas, others have pointed out, seems to me there are loads of violations of international law in violating in violating that involves property, not just genocide. And so an argument that's made against your side is look what you're opening up. I mean, you can have slavery involving property. You can have systematic discrimination. You can have cruel and unhuman degrading treatment. I mean, the list goes on and on of what violates international law. And many of them involve property. And if we can bring these kinds of actions here, well, so can these other countries do the same and accuse us. I mean, what about Japanese internment, which involved 30,000 people in World War II who were not American citizens but were of Japanese origin? And the first time we'd sue China for the Rohingyas or whatever, you know, what do you think they're going to say about the the the railroad workers who came to the 19th century? I mean, that seems no way to limit it according to a principle that would say we should have the actions here that are universalizable and won't hurt, through chaos, if they're brought everywhere. That's a fairly strong argument. And so I think that that's why I want to hear you answer it.
",1.163535237312317
761,19-351,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3523.165,3554.355," Well, why isn't it? Why isn't it a taking of property in violation of international law where, in country X, they have child slavery involving children from other countries, and they take the property in deed, whether or not you call it labor as a property. They take other property too. And so they come to court, and 700 judges in this country pass judgment on that. Why doesn't that fall within the language?
",0.5075752139091492
762,19-351,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3560.325,3594.035," Why it doesn't? Suing them into slavery, bringing them into slavery doesn't cause the deprivation of the house they own in the adjacent country? It doesn't involve the deprivation of sometimes their clothing and sometimes their gold teeth, as Justice Thomas said? I mean, terrible things happen in this world. And that's why I was somewhat moved by Eizenstat's statement that the way to go after them practically is through all kinds of mediation, arbitration, and other kinds of special agreements, and not necessarily 700 judges.

763,19-351,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3638.935,3662.725," I want to make sure I understand the scope of your argument. At times in your brief, particularly when you refer to the absence from the provision in question of any reference to aliens, you seem to be making an argument that would apply to any domestic taking. But that's not your argument, am I right?
",0.21519900858402252
764,19-351,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3667.1,3687.46," Okay. So is is it your argument that any taking that violates any principle of international law would be covered, or is your argument limited to those acts that constitute genocide or those that are part of a campaign of genocide, or is it a Holocaust-specific argument?
",-1.3798710107803345
765,19-351,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3708.88999995,3749.325," Well, since World War II, customary international law has expanded greatly. Prior to World War II, it was largely, if not entirely, limited to relations between nations, but, in reaction to the Holocaust, to those horrors, customary international law has reached out and now protects many human rights. So would your argument apply to any taking that violates any principle of human rights recognized by customary international law or by treaties since the Second World War?

766,19-351,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3783.015,3810.13500005," Even if it's limited to genocide there have been many incidents in the past that some people claim are genocidal. Sometimes these are hotly disputed. I won't go through the list. I hope there won't be more in the future, but, given human nature, that's a possibility. Wouldn't your argument require courts to decide whether a particular event that indisputably involved atrocities amounted to genocide?

769,19-351,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4014.06,4052.14999995," All right. Is one of the things that I'm dealing with in my own head is how would we determine I know the amici make their argument but given that there hasn't been a recognition of causes of actions against sovereigns in other in other countries for expropriation of property within the borders of a nation, how will we ever determine that question? How can we ask the courts below to determine that question outside of an academic discussion?

So why would that make sense?
",-0.05122864991426468
771,19-351,Elena_Kagan_,4198.7,4236.28," Maybe we should forswear the kind of ordinary meaning textualism that you're asking us to adopt in this context. Mr. Kneedler said, you know, we've long understood that the FSIA codifies the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, which, except for narrow exceptions, gives the foreign sovereign immunity for public acts. So why in that context shouldn't we be thinking a little bit more than we typically do about actually what Congress had in mind when it when it drafted these exceptions?

This remained true despite knowledge of the genocide convention and the Hague Convention, which would have contained language more like what you're asking us to read into this statute. Then you get the Hickenlooper Amendments as well. And that's all before we even get to some of the other statutory clues that Judge Katsas pointed out. Why doesn't that as a matter of ordinary meaning at the time of the statute's passage stand as pretty strong evidence against you taking collectively?

773,19-351,Neil_Gorsuch_,4426.36,4468.95," Okay. And then, if if your if your contrary reading were correct, I I think you've agreed that property property takings or taken, if you will, because of a genocide is not going to be the limit of our jurisdiction. It's also going to include any other human rights violation norms that that that somehow are related to property. I would have thought terrorism, slavery were a couple of examples we batted around. I'm sure there are going to be many others. But I'm not I'm not understanding what your limiting principle is. It seemed to be some sort of causation analysis.

No one doubts that this was part of of of a horrific genocidal conduct by Nazi Germany and the Third Reich, but I I don't think anybody would contend that the taking of property was the only or or maybe even the most grotesque aspect of the genocide. And I don't see why the same couldn't be said of other human rights violations, like slavery, like like like terrorism. I'm sorry for going over, but I'd appreciate your response.

776,19-351,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4613.3,4634.56," And that would suggest, I suppose, that there is a a universal norm or close to universal norm of international law to provide immunity for foreign nations in those circumstances, at least immunity in courts outside their own their own countries?

777,19-351,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4637.745,4731.81," Then, on the question of the text, the argument is really the term of art argument did this language have a settled meaning at the time, and we've explored that back and back and forth a little bit. Justice Thomas, I think, asked you whether your reading of the FSIA would be a significant departure, and you said no a significant departure from the understanding at the time, you said no. One thing I wanted to ask you about, and give you an opportunity to respond, is the current Restatement, the Restatement Fourth, you're well aware the reporter's note to Section 455 says that ""By eliminating the domestic takings rule and permitting claims to proceed on allegations of takings incurred occurred in the context of egregious violations of international law, this line of decisions referring to the current cases we're talking about this line of decisions appears to expand the scope of 1605(a)(3) well beyond the original intent of the Congress, potentially opening courts of the United States to a wide range of property-related claims arising out of foreign internal conflicts characterized by widespread human rights violations."" So what's your response to the reporter's note in the current Restatement saying that this line of decisions goes well beyond what Congress would have understood?
",-0.4729388654232025
778,19-351,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4792.815,4858.925," Counsel, the distinction that you're drawing between ""taken"" and ""taking"" seems awfully thin to me because, you know, if I'm looking at 1605(a)(3), in the way that it's drafted, I mean, one could say with with reference to our takings clause in which ""rights in property taken in violation of the takings clause"" or in violation of the Fifth Amendment I mean, and moreover, when you go to the Clarification Act, it does use the word ""taking"" in in referring back. I'm looking now in let me find the in (h)(2)(B), if you look down into the subsections, it talks about the taking having occurred after 1900. So the statute does use the word ""taking"" and the way that (h) 1606(a)(3) is drafted, it would be hard to say anything other than ""taken."" So really does your argument depend that much on the distinction between ""taking"" and property ""taken""?
",0.08725833147764206
779,19-351,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4905.46,4946," But, Mr. O'Donnell, a lot of the force of your argument depends on the ordinary meaning of the terms and relying just on, you know, ""property taken in violation of international law"" rather than saying it in a term of art way. But, at the same time, you've pointed to all kinds of limitations that might exist outside of that ordinary meaning of the text; for example, this is just genocide or just if Congress calls it genocide. Can you identify some of the limiting principles, say, you said maybe this is just the Holocaust, the Nazi Holocaust, or maybe this is just genocide, maybe it's just a genocide if Congress identifies it as such? Are those the only limitations you might find in that text?

780,19-351,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4991.58,5015.53000005," Okay, but, counsel, it's very difficult to see, in the examples that Justice Gorsuch was giving you, for example, how property taken in the course of enslaving people wouldn't fall into this very same logic that you're articulating here. And I think you're struggling to identify limits because you know that it's problematic to interpret it so broadly that it would have the 700 district judges in the country adjudicating all these kinds of claims.

I thought that in Voisine, that the statute there covered the use of force by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabit cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse.

So, to take the Chief Justice's example, I have my baseball bat I'm swinging around. I know I am the worst baseball player in history. I know that this baseball bat is likely to slip out of my hands and bump somebody on the head. There's a person standing in front of me. I think: Oh, God, that person may be hit. I don't want him to, but he might be because I'm so bad. And then I swing it, and he's hit. All right.

But, as I look at the charging statutes that encompass recklessness, many of them, including in Tennessee, where this crime was committed, involve conduct that that's hard to think of as reckless and more as negligent, for example, the individual who was charged with recklessly causing injury who was blinded by the sun, and there are other examples of that.

I I I appreciate that you want us to draw a firm and clear line between recklessness and negligence, as the model penal code does, but I've been kind of curious about some of your responses, which blur the line between recklessness and other mens rea, higher up, knowledge and intent, which the model penal code also treats as distinct and importantly so. And I guess I'm curious where where you think the the statute draws the line. Would a knowledge crime trigger the ACCA under your view? It seems like, in the reply brief, you concede that almost, but I'm not clear why.
",0.06676822900772095
797,19-5410,Neil_Gorsuch_,1335.32,1363.01," Well, no, no, no, that that's where you're wrong. It certainly does in tort, but the model penal code draws a firm distinction between them. And it's true that sometimes a jury can infer intent from knowledge because very few defendants will admit they secretly harbored a nefarious intention. And it's also true that in tort and other areas we sometimes collapse the two. But the model penal code treats them as distinct. So --

798,19-5410,Neil_Gorsuch_,1389.28,1424.445," All right. Counsel, I really don't want to get involved in that argument with you, okay? Assume that intent and knowledge are distinct mental elements, and it can be it it may be it may be the statute depends on, you know, what the an object of of the mens rea may be different, okay, whether the the consequences that you have to have a mens rea attach to it or not. Forget about that, okay? Forget about all of that. Why wouldn't we, if we're taking the statute seriously, and and looking at the rule of lenity, start with the assumption that until Congress tells us otherwise, this has to be an intent statute?
",0.38566696643829346
799,19-5410,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1479.205,1544.26," Okay. But but, if we follow Voisine, then yes. So it's because it says ""use of"" if it said ""use of force,"" it covers reckless offenses. If it says ""use of force against another,"" it does not cover reckless offenses. And I guess I'm just thinking that's a very strange line to draw. Judge Sutton in Verwiebe he's a very wise judge, as you know said sometimes the simplest explanation is the best explanation. And it seems like, if you're trying to make sense of Leocal and Voisine together, the simplest and I think potentially the best explanation I want to get your reaction is negligent conduct is not use of force and reckless conduct is use of force for purposes of these statutes because, I think to pick up on what Justice Thomas said, it would be a bit wild to say reckless crimes are covered by ""use of force"" statutes but not by ""use of force against another"" statutes. So can you respond to that?
",0.7651861310005188
800,19-5410,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1594.67,1666.63," Well, on the on the textual point, I think you're making a point, I think, that ordinary usage of ""against the person of another"" is itself what excludes recklessness. But then, if you look at the Voisine opinion and I don't mean this as a gotcha point at all but just kind of an an example of ordinary usage it describes the offense there even though it didn't the statute didn't say ""against another,"" on page 1, as ""any misdemeanor committed against a domestic relation""; on page 4, ""recklessly assaulting a domestic relation""; on page 7, ""the harm such conduct causes as the result of a deliberate decision to endanger another""; page 8, ""who assaults another""; page 9, referring to the main statute, ""to recklessly injure another""; on page 12, ""federal law applies to those with prior convictions for the use of physical force against a domestic relation."" The point being, in explaining the ordinary use of the phrase ""use of force,"" it was describing it indistinguishable from ""use of force against another."" Can you respond to that?

801,19-5410,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1694.475,1719.35," Good morning, Mr. Shanmugam. A few minutes ago, you said that Congress you described the heartland of crimes of violence as murder, rape, assault. I I have a question about assault. Many statutes include recklessness in the definition of assault. So wouldn't the categorical approach mean that if recklessness isn't included, assault's out?
",-0.647182047367096
802,19-5410,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1819.78,1854," Mr. Shanmugam, let me just interrupt so I don't run out of time. I have another question. So the word ""against"" let me just read you this definition it can mean in into contact or collision with, toward, upon. In Justice Kagan's hypothetical where the bank robber is pulling out and she sees in the rearview mirror that someone is standing eight feet behind the car, why doesn't that definition fairly encompass harm a use of force that is toward, in collision with someone, or conscious disregard of the risk of someone? It doesn't seem to me a stretch of the English language to use it that way.
",-0.014366147108376026
803,19-5410,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2139.39,2172.43," Recklessness does cover a a fairly broad range. You know, it does cover my swinging the baseball bat that slips, but, as I think your friend on the other side just noted, it can also cover things like, you know, failing to buckle in the child in the in the car seat or texting while driving. And I don't think in any of those situations you would say that that's using force against that those those individuals.

804,19-5410,Clarence_Thomas_,2275.105,2299.65500005," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, just briefly if you could. There seems to be a bit of tension between Voisine and Leocal. Could you just comment on that and then also spend a little bit of time explaining why Leocal doesn't sort of doesn't imperil your case?
",-1.4066370725631714
805,19-5410,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2481.35,2580.55," In going back to the statute itself, what it does is it takes, say, possession of a firearm or ammunition, which is illegal, and it changes the sentence from no minimum up to 10 years to a 15-year minimum sentence up to life, and that happens where you have three prior crimes that fit the definition. That's a pretty serious consequence. So this Court, I think, has struggled to try to make sure the really bad things are in those three priors and not things that are not quite so bad. So that's why I find Leocal and Begay pretty much on point. Now Begay, we had drunk driving. And dozens quite a few states make drunk driving they put in that recklessness. All right. We had it and we said in the residual clause, you have to have the the residual clause is closer to what you want, 'cause it talks about a serious potential risk of physical injury. And we said there has to be conduct in those three priors that is violent, aggressive, and purposeful. Now we add a residual clause and you have words that are much closer to here. And we're trying to get out drunk driving because it just isn't the right category, given the statute. Why isn't this case a fortiori?
",1.0304882526397705
806,19-5410,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2749.59,2773.17," Well, it's always a pleasure to have another case involving the Armed Career Criminal Act. It is a real it is a real favorite. Do you think that Leocal allows us to say that the ""against"" that the phrase ""against the person of another"" does not speak at all to the question of mens rea?
",-0.40829479694366455
807,19-5410,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2828.18,2868.22," You you point out that if we adopt Petitioner's interpretation, crimes like second degree murder and a lot of assault offenses will not qualify as ACCA predicates. And the Petitioner responds that if we adopt your interpretation, drunk driving offenses and other less serious offenses involving reckless conduct will qualify. So which of these two parades of horribles is more horrible?
",-0.5613778233528137
808,19-5410,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2976.2,3087.36500005," Counsel, in terms of the parade of horribles, I I do think it's important to remember that judges always have the ability to decide somebody or to hold that reckless conduct doesn't qualify you for an ACCA enhancement but that the crime you committed, all the horribles that you describe, do command a greater sentence. So it's not as if these people are going to get away scot scot-free. I I also point to something that the government said in its response brief in Voisine, and that responsive brief made an opposite point than the one you advanced today. I'm quoting from your Voisine brief: ""While both provisions contain the phrase use of physical force, the domestic violence provision, and ACCA, the misdemeanor crime of violence definition omits the remainder of the Leocal's provision Section 16 definition, which qualifies that the force is against the person or property of another."" You said the ""against"" phrase was crucial to Leocal's holding, which required a higher mens rea. And yet today you're telling us that that ""against"" ""force directed against the person"" has no meaning, that the only meaning is was your conduct reckless and did it happen to cause physical injury. Were you wrong then and right now?
",0.42696884274482727
809,19-5410,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3158.94,3199.79," in Leocal, we said that a DWI cannot be a crime of violence because it does not require the use of force against the person of another. And it didn't it happened to be negligence, but its entire focus was, was the force directed at another person. It seems to me that since Tennessee and many other states are putting drunken driving in their assault statutes like this one, that what we're doing is sub silentio overruling Leocal. Maybe not sub silentio, but that's what our intent is. And that's what you're asking us to do.
",0.7760307192802429
810,19-5410,Elena_Kagan_,3230.58,3322.74," Mr. Feigin, as as you know, Voisine expressly reserves this question, just as Leocal expressly reserved the recklessness question. And and in that footnote where it does reserve it, it says the context and purposes of the statutes may be sufficiently different to require a different reading. And and this, I suppose, goes back to Justice Breyer's questions, because I think the argument might go, or at least part of the argument might go, that in ACCA, one is defining what it means to be a violent felon for purposes of imposing an extremely significant punishment, whereas, in this statute, one is talking about misdemeanors and applying only a prophylactic rule about gun possession. And, further, I mean, Voisine spends as as much time talking about the effects of coming out the other way than it does about the text. In other words, it basically says, if we don't hold the way we are holding today, this entire federal scheme will be rendered inoperative. And and that seems very different no matter if you can come up with, you know, 13 robbery statutes or or something like that, that seems an extremely different consequence of a ruling. So I guess I would ask you to respond to that set of things that might serve to distinguish this case from Voisine.

811,19-5410,Neil_Gorsuch_,3434.92,3494.83," Good morning, Mr. Feigin. I I guess one other possible distinction textually between this and Voisine, of course, is that we don't have the phrase ""against the person or property of another."" And I know in that case and we do here. And in Leocal, I I guess I'm still stuck. You you you don't seem to want us to read very much into that phrase, but Leocal says whether or not the word ""use"" alone supplies a mens rea element, the parties' primary focus on that word is too narrow. Then it goes on to say, ""the key phrase 'use of physical force against the person or property of another' most naturally suggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental."" Suggesting that phrase has some work to do in mens rea. And I guess I'm still struggling with how, if we're to take our precedent seriously, we ignore that construction, which isn't present in Voisine, irrelevant in Voisine.
",0.6061828136444092
812,19-5410,Neil_Gorsuch_,3509.19,3532.385," All right. But that answer that it just relates to the object of the force runs directly counter to Leocal's express instruction that it has something to say about mens rea. And it also renders, as your friend pointed out, that phrase, ""person of another or property of another,"" superfluous in Leocal itself. What do we do about that?
",0.05082318186759949
813,19-5410,Neil_Gorsuch_,3577.43,3615.48500005," That phrase isn't in Voisine, is your problem. Let me ask you another question if we're not going to get more progress there. What do we do about the rule of lenity? And this statute is supposed to provide notice not to nine judges on the Supreme Court who are struggling with it but to ordinary Americans. And if if we can't make heads or tails of it and every circuit to have addressed it up until recently came out against you, why shouldn't we if Congress wishes to legislate here further, and, of course, it may, why shouldn't we here say the tie goes to the defendant, the presumptively free defendant?
",0.546072244644165
814,19-5410,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3650.21,3688.86," Good afternoon, Mr. Feigin. I want to pick up on Justice Gorsuch's point about precedent because we have two precedents we have to make sense of, Leocal and Voisine. And in your brief, I I thought the answer that you were giving about the distinction of Leocal and this is page 13 of your brief ""The Court in Voisine accordingly made clear that the critical distinction recognized in Leocal itself is between accidents and recklessness, not recklessness and knowledge or intention."" In other words, that Leocal stands for the idea that negligence doesn't come within this kind of language. Is that right?
",-0.30883145332336426
815,19-5410,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3707.54,3801.34," Exactly. Well, so so I'm sorry to interrupt, but the the point being that Leocal recognizes the distinction that's traditional: Negligence, out; recklessness and above, per model penal code, is usually considered more important. But you don't have to guess because you have Voisine, I guess, that draws that distinction. And so that's what I thought the distinction was between Leocal and Voisine, but as your brief said. The other thing I wanted to get to is the notice point has been raised here. And it seems to me that the notice in this kind of statute is a little bit different, but and this is more of a comment, and you can fill in the gaps of it. But we're not talking about notice for committing reckless assault under Tennessee law. What we're talking about is someone who's been convicted three times for separate offenses under Tennessee law, or other state law, who then, after being convicted of three violent felonies, knowing they shouldn't possess firearms, nonetheless possesses firearms on notice they shouldn't possess firearms because they've been convicted of these prior offenses. So you actually have to four times have committed some pretty significant violation before you fall into this statute. Is that I mean, that's my understanding, and I think that's the important point on notice, but you can elaborate if you wish.

So, you know, the statute ""to qualify as a crime of violence must have as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force,"" suggesting that the kind of use of physical force is the kind that can be attempted or threatened. Does that have any significance here? Do those terms, ""attempted"" and ""threatened,"" make sense when applied to reckless conduct?

So, you know, one of the amici argues that including recklessness in ACCA is going to drag us into some of the same problems that we had under the residual clause. And this is picking up a thread that you started to touch on earlier. Is that true?

818,20-543,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,136.71,164.35," Counsel, as I think you confirmed in this opening statement, you rely heavily on the legislative history, the congressional purpose, the post-enactment history, and there was a time when this Court also relied on those sources, but this this is not that time.

Okay. I don't know what's in that 150 statutes. I suspect that some of them it makes sense to apply to the corporations, the Alaska Indian the corporations, and some it doesn't.

But, if you can't prevail on that basis, I can see one textual argument that could possibly work for you, and you make it only in passing, and that is that the clause ""which is recognized as eligible"" doesn't mean formal recognition in the sense in which Indian Tribes are recognized.

If we were to take the other possible textual approach and say that ""recognize"" doesn't mean formal recognition, what effect would that have in other statutes that use this same definition?

But I'm also understanding, I believe and you can confirm or disaffirm that there are many other housing assistance, healthcare, and social service to thousands of Alaska natives each year by the ANCs. Would our if we were to accept Respondents' position and the D.C.

I understand that. But there's just no grammatical way to read this statute the way you want to read it, no grammatical way, which isn't to say that that's not what Congress intended.

I mean, we often say that Alaska is different. And that seems to be the case here, that the government had recognized native groups without traditional historic bonds. ANCs would have resembled tribes in that they owned land. I mean, we just have sort of different groups here, and why might Congress not have thought, well, we'll see how it all plays out and maybe one day, given the the circumstances of Alaska, these groups will be recognized?

834,20-543,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1556.32,1633.215," Good morning, Mr. Guarnieri. I want to go back to the eligibility clause. So you you told several of my colleagues that the recognition clause that one way to understand it is that it's a term of art but that it has a well, that you could take its ordinary meaning, simply, you know, an entity that contracts with the federal government for services that are designed to go to Indians because of their status as Indians. And you said, well, sure, you can look at this, and I understand it's your backup argument, but you can understand it in its ordinary meaning as the other Petitioner advocates for. Now you say but a lesser-included definition would be the term-of-art recognition definition like we see in the later-passed List Act. I don't really see how you can have a a lesser included specialized definition. It seems to me either it's ordinary meaning or it's not. And, you know, you're kind of cagey in your brief and I think a little bit at oral argument too about whether, in fact, that eligibility clause refers to FRT status. So which is it? I mean, is this the first time that the government has taken the position that language like this doesn't refer to FRT status?
",0.3805810213088989
835,20-543,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1675.15,1717.8," But but let me just ask you. That sounds like you're folding back into your argument about, well, specific mention of the Alaskan entities would have not made any sense if the eligibility clause was designed to apply to them because ANCs by their very composition have you know, they were designed to channel money from the federal government to their shareholders, and so they had that status from the beginning. So what I'm asking you is a little bit different because, if the ordinary meaning, say, of that eligibility clause prevails, then we don't have to we could rule in your favor without doing this kind of fancy footwork around the awkward grammatical reading of the statute.

In your brief, you compare this statute to the case of a caretaker being told to feed the cats, the dogs, and goldfish, which are barking, and but the force of that analogy comes from the fact that it's impossible for the goldfish to bark. In this case, though, Congress has the authority, right, to formally recognize the ANCs? And so doesn't that undermine your analogy?

840,20-543,Neil_Gorsuch_,2707.845,2744.215," Good morning, Mr. Clement. It seems to me that the government is a little nervous about moving off of recognition in its formal sense because it's concerned about self-identifying groups declaring their eligibility for a lot of federal programs. And you're a little less concerned about that, understandably, but there are a couple of a couple of terms there that just I I struggle with. To the extent we're defining a tribal government for the CARES Act, isn't that an odd fit for a corporate board?

Is it your understanding, I think, from what you're saying that the canon is something of an exception to ordinary meaning? In other words, sometimes you'll look at a phrase or words and say the ordinary meaning is X, but the term of art that we know is is Y? Is that your understanding of how it works?

843,20-543,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3003.435,3021.56999995," Mr. Clement, why wouldn't it make sense? I mean, as you just pointed out, the List Act uses language that's identical to the eligibility clause in ISDA, so why then aren't ANCs really practically automatically recognized under the List Act?

844,20-543,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3107.96,3135.385," I mean, I can see that, but it's kind of at war with the the plain meaning of the text if it's understood to be a term of art. And, I mean, I take your point that maybe it wasn't a term of art when ISDA was enacted but became so later, particularly after the List Act. But can you think of any other instance in statutory interpretation where something has had its ordinary meaning in the beginning and then gained a term of art where then you interpret statutes differently depending on where they fell along the continuum of that process?

845,20-543,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3365.005,3435.505," Counsel, your side's fundamental argument is that the text is clear and that that doesn't include by the time you get to the end of the sentence, it doesn't include the ANCs. But the text itself, in in the middle of the the the clause, does include the ANCs, and then that same clause, under your reading, takes eligibility away from the ANCs. And my question is, why doesn't that text undermine the plain language argument? In other words, we're not talking about some overriding purpose. We're not talking about legislative history. What we're talking about is the text, and the text says in the list ANCs. And then the text takes away eligibility. And it seems to me that that text creates ambiguity so that it a textual reading isn't a plain reading. What what's your answer to that?

They didn't at the time. That was the whole point. This was a revolution in the relationship between the national government and Native American governments. These were not governmental organizations. There was no uncertainty at the time. The whole point was that they were not governmental entities.

It had not been used in any prior statute. It was crafted by Congress and put in the CARES Act. And the CARES Act provides a one-time distribution of money, and at the time of the enactment of the CARES Act, no ANC had been recognized in the sense that you think is necessary. How then would you account for the reference to ANCs in the definition of an Indian Tribe? Would you make the same argument, or would your argument have to be different?

No ANC had been recognized in that sense at the time when Congress made this one-time distribution of funds. And yet Congress referred to ANCs in the definition of groups that are eligible for these funds. There's a blatant contradiction.

856,20-543,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4331.53,4361.84499995," All right. Let me come back to my my example. Is there any reason why we should not analyze the CARES Act as if the definition of an Indian Tribe had been created for that purpose and in instead of incorporating by reference a definition that was adopted at at a different time? Do you see a difference between those two things?
",-0.8105469346046448
857,20-543,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4387.025,4414.89," But you would escape you tried to escape absurdity by saying that when the ISDA definition was adopted, there was a possibility that ANCs would be recognized in the relevant sense, and at some point in the future, Congress might decide to recognize ANCs in that sense. But, when you just look at the time when the CARES Act was adopted, we know that no ANC had been recognized in that sense.

858,20-543,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4421.23999995,4541.79," Counsel, we do keep going around in a circle, and the circle starts with the fact that even the government recognizes, and you must too, that in 1974 the recognition clause could not have meant political recognition because that didn't exist at the time. It only existed in the 1990s. So 45 years ago, in 1974 is my math right when ISDA was passed, there was no term of art that you were recognized as a government body. So now what you're arguing, I think, is that's clear today when the CARES Act was passed, but, as Justice Alito just pointed out, then why would Congress have bothered to include ANCs in the CARE Act at all since, after 45 years, it clearly knows now that no ANC has ever been politically recognized? Now I think the government's absurdity absurdity argument has more force because, in 45 years, not a one if we accept what the D.C. Circuit said, that in 1974 it was uncertain whether some would be recognized politically, it's clear now it's not going to be. So don't we have to accept Mr. Clement's argument that ISDA's language, as used in the CARES Act, cannot mean political recognition?

And I'm going to hope that in its reply, the government will address that question, which is it may not be the case with some of ISDA's uses in other acts, like the Housing Act, and in other provisions of care, coronavirus care, where that governing body definition isn't included, that one could argue take up the recognition argument that Mr. Clement has made more clearly. But perhaps then I'll stop now and let the government pick that up later.

860,20-543,Elena_Kagan_,4611.605,4692.75499995," Mr. Rasmussen, you know, I agree with you that grammar is very important in understanding statutes and that grammar often allows us to choose between two possible meanings of a statute. But you have to have another possible meaning for grammar to serve that function, and the question is whether there really is another conceivable meaning here. So you said there is because Congress in the future could have recognized ANCs. Justice Alito said to you it had never done that in the past. But there's there's something even more than that which seems to make this an implausible understanding, which is that, you know, putting aside whether it's theoretically plausible, I mean, ANCs are just different from the Tribes that were recognized at the time. They are nonprofit corporations excuse me, for-profit corporations. No historic bonds. Members who aren't shareholders who aren't members of the tribe. And why should we even think that Congress had that in mind as a possibility at the time to make these federally recognized tribes?

And if I say, you know, it's theoretically possible, Congress has the authority to do this, but if you went around and you polled Congress and you said do you think of ANCs as federally recognized tribes, they would say, well, of course not.

Your brief was expressed concern that ruling for the ANCs would allow a sort of double-dipping, that they'd be counted twice for purposes of the CARES Act. Mr. Clement responded to that concern this morning by suggesting that the federal government has lots of ways to administratively ensure that that doesn't occur. If that's right, it's hard to see what we're fighting about here. Can you explain your views?

The CARES Act speaks of tribal governments, and I asked Mr. Clement, is that an awkward fit with ANCs, for-profit corporations? And he suggested no, that it's entirely possible that native tribes in the lower 48 could organize themselves in a similar fashion. What what are your thoughts about that?

865,20-543,Neil_Gorsuch_,5095.33,5114.435," And and just to return to a question that Justice Thomas posed that I'm not sure I got the answer to, if if effectively this recognition clause asks us to to inquire whether the tribe's recognized, why didn't Congress just cross-reference the List Act?

866,20-543,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,5170.245,5250.345," Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Rasmussen. I want to give you an opportunity to respond to how I think the two statutory arguments on the other side merge potentially. So it seems to me, if we start with the text and we look at ""recognized as eligible,"" we have a choice. Do we read that in its ordinary meaning, as Mr. Clement says, or do we read it as a term of art? And that's a choice we have, and we have to figure out, how do we resolve that? And one of the ways we usually resolve that is looking at the context to see how Congress might have been using the phrase here. And once we broaden out the lens and look at the context, we see the express inclusion of the ANCs and we see that they would be left out completely, meaning many tens of thousands of native Alaskans would be left out completely not only from the CARES Act but from many other social services statutes. So, given that context, if that's correct, why doesn't that absurdity or oddity or whatever you want to call it help influence the choice we have to make between whether to follow ordinary meaning or term-of-art meaning for the phrase ""recognized as eligible""?
",-0.23139919340610504
867,20-543,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,5332.26,5358.2," And when we figure out do we go ordinary meaning or we go term of art on that, it seems that the express inclusion of the ANCs, and given some of the points that have been made, no one thought the ANCs would ever be politically recognized now or then or in the future, doesn't that help us choose ordinary meaning rather than term-of-art meaning here so as to avoid that oddity, that absurdity, et cetera?
",0.38738566637039185
868,20-543,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,5387.27,5401.765," And on the on the ratification argument, you said, well, that doesn't apply when there's a plain meaning. But I'm not sure we have a plain meaning. And your argument's really not plain meaning because you're relying on a term-of-art construction of ""recognized as eligible.""
",0.5045393705368042
869,20-543,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,5430.09,5473.48," let me ask one other thing. The amicus briefs from Senators Murkowski and Sullivan and Congressman Young, from the Alaska Federation of Natives, from the State of Alaska, from Cook Inlet, they used terms like ""stunning,"" ""egregious,"" ""destabilizing,"" ""staggering,"" in terms of the effects that an affirmance would have on this program but also many other programs. Now they know Alaska. They know how these statutes fit together. The members of Congress from Alaska are are appropriately attentive to this. Why are they wrong in describing the consequences of choosing the term of art over ordinary meaning?
",0.650507390499115
870,20-543,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5519.765,5539.06," Mr. Rasmussen, I want to be sure that I understand your position. You told Justice Thomas and then I think you repeated again to Justice Kavanaugh that what it takes to establish a trust relationship between a native Alaskan or a Native American from the lower 48 is enrollment in a tribe. Did I understand that correctly?
",-0.9481988549232483
871,20-543,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5548.46,5583.84," Okay. Well, then what do we make I'm going to read you this language from ANCSA, and I'm wondering how to fit that in with your theory. It says: ""Alaska natives shall remain eligible for all federal Indian programs on the same basis as other Native Americans notwithstanding any other provision of law."" I would take that to mean that because of Alaska's unusual, indeed, very distinct method of handling benefits to Native Americans, that that amendment to ANCSA makes clear that that trust relationship exists even though they don't enroll in tribes. Am I wrong about that?
",0.0867019072175026
872,20-543,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5608.55,5627.83," So so it's your position that native Alaskans have no right to any benefits, even though they are even though they are automatically put in ANCs if they don't enroll in Alaskan villages, you know, the equivalent of tribes, it's your position that despite this language in ANCSA they're entitled to nothing from the federal government?
",-0.2661633789539337
873,20-543,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5648.97,5695.955," Mr. Rasmussen, I think you're not understanding my question. You asserted broadly that the trust relationship between the United States and a native person is established when that native person enrolls in a tribe. And I took you to be saying that the United States doesn't have any kind of trust obligation to a native person who is unenrolled. And you invoked the example of those who live in the lower 48 who have not affiliated with any tribe, although it strikes me as different because native Alaskans, it's not just a free-floating group that self-identifies but are put into as shareholders in ANCs if they choose not to enroll in a village. So I'm trying to understand how to reconcile what you said with this language in ANCSA, and you're referring to other statutes apart from ANCSA.
",0.45085132122039795
874,20-543,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5738.71,5763.845," So every native Alaskan who's unaffiliated with a tribe but is a shareholder in an ANC isn't eligible for benefits as you know, as Indians? I mean, it's not just about what intermediary you receive those benefits through or whether you receive them directly from the BIA or another federal entity. You're saying that they are then no different than, say, any other citizen of Alaska that is not native Alaskan?
",-0.08554792404174805
875,20-543,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5786.57,5823.43," Let me just shift gears before my time expires, Mr. Rasmussen. You were earlier in your argument, you were saying characterizing this as somewhat of a dispute when Justice Gorsuch was asking you about double-counting, about who delivers the benefits, whether it's the villages or the ANCs. But isn't this really about whether the lower 48 are allocated more money; in other words, that the primary dispute here isn't about governance or who serves as the intermediary or the ANCs being able to trump how the villages might decide things but what piece of the pie goes where?
",-0.13384880125522614
876,20-543,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,5838.33,5943.19," Mr. Rasmussen, we have a little bit of time left for any questions my colleagues may have that they didn't get a chance to get to. And I'll I'll start us off. I want to follow up on the question Justice Barrett and Justice Kavanaugh were asking because I thought that's what the case was really all about. In other words, there are Alaska natives who are not enrolled members of a village who receive significant services from ANCs, services that the availability of what is directly impacted by the COVID pandemic. And tens of thousands of people fit that description. And I I understand you're you're doing what lawyers do, which is trying, you know, to get more money for your clients. But the enrolled members receive those benefits and, if you prevail, I gather, will receive more. But the Alaska natives who benefit from the services provided by the ANCs will get will get nothing. And I just wonder if that's what Congress and maybe, you know, your plain language argument, maybe the answer is that, well, that doesn't matter, but I wonder if there's anybody in Congress who would think that Alaska natives receive significant benefits if they're enrolled in a tribe but not if their benefits are provided through the ANCs. I did not understand Congress to be sort of pushing in favor of enrollment at the expense of participation by ANCs.

If you keep your car without using it inside your property for 10 years, they want to go inspect it. They have to do that because it might blow up. They had no spaceships at common law.

Is this a question of whether it's a property interest under California law today, or is it a question whether it would be regarded as a property interest at the time of the adoption of the Fifth Amendment, or is it something else?

Under your theory and you're creating sort of a federal common law definition of what an easement is because you're not referring to California law, you're not referring to common law, I I guess you want us to make it up somehow.

But let me ask you this, counsel: Aren't you then just conceding that this is not a per se rule? And we have very few per se rules in this area. In Arkansas Game, my late colleague, Justice Ginsburg, explained that there are nearly infinite ways of in which government actions can affect property interests. The Court has recognized few and variable rules in this area. So, given that, why don't we just take the Arkansas Game theory or, not theory, variables and apply them to this case? Why don't you win under that? You're claiming and that's what the dissent said in the in the panel decision. You're claiming that this is different than than the Babcock situation or similar to the Babcock situation because people don't live on the premises, they're easily accessible, they speak English more than Spanish, and I'm not even sure the language difference makes the language difference makes a difference in our analysis, but don't you win under Babcock?
",0.5402898788452148
888,20-107,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1051.31,1087.69," Counsel, that's just simply not true, because we've had access right cases like Kaiser Aetna and PruneYards, even Arkansas Game, which were invasions of the right to exclude. All those cases were identical to this one stick in the bundle of rights. And, there, we just didn't apply a per se rule. We found in in we suggested that some takings, like in Arkansas Game, were unconstitutional but not under a per se analysis.
",0.7932902574539185
889,20-107,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1106.34,1124.535," And one question: Is your rule of applicable can we exempt your absolutist rule and say it applies to only situations in which government in which access is provided to someone who's not a government official or a government agent or contractor?
",-1.6321296691894531
890,20-107,Elena_Kagan_,1179.05,1211.34," Mr. Thompson, if I could go back first to your answers to Justice Thomas. Let let let's say that I don't think that this would count as an easement under California law for a variety of reasons that Justice Thomas gave and Justice Alito gave. Let's just assume that to be true. You do keep on talking about a discrete interest in property. So I guess my question is, what discrete interest are you talking about if not an easement as defined by California law?
",-0.580325186252594
891,20-107,Elena_Kagan_,1218.59,1246.12," Yeah, I mean, I know what the thing says, but I don't think, like, the denial of a right to exclude counts as a discrete interest in property. I mean, the right to exclude is one of the sticks in the bundle that a property owner has, but usually, when people talk about discrete interests in property, it's like a legal form. It's an easement. It's a fee simple. It's something like that. But you're not pointing to anything like that. Am I right?
",1.0144679546356201
892,20-107,Elena_Kagan_,1254.26,1318.48," Sorry. If if you talk a lot about background principles of property law, and and that's the way you save every inspection regime and every search regime, that somehow that there's a that there is a background principle of property law that is incorporated into this analysis so that these property owners don't really have a property right to exclude inspectors and so forth. But then you put that you you you time that as of, I think this goes to what Justice Alito was talking about as of the time of the ratification of the Constitution. And I guess I wonder why that should be, because this these questions of what is your property interest seems as though it shouldn't stop at the time of the Constitution. The Takings Clause operates as against whatever it is that property generally means. But why should that freeze at that time?
",-0.14319336414337158
893,20-107,Neil_Gorsuch_,1399.36,1427.425," Counsel, I think I'd like you to have a little more opportunity to respond to the the charge that this would be revolutionary and the end of all regulatory regimes and that the government would never be able to walk on anyone's property again to to do a search or or to conduct tests or ensure the safety of of licensed operations there, whether it's a power plant or otherwise. Would you address that concern, please?
",-0.47930318117141724
894,20-107,Neil_Gorsuch_,1479.535,1531.36," Well, what if California had passed an identical regulation to the one here, except that instead of allowing union organizers access, it allowed union opponents access in order to speak with employees about the downsides of joining a union? So, again, not a government worker coming to do a search to ensure compliance with the regulatory regime but a third party being permitted and given a right to access the property. Or or or suppose if California had allowed any member of the public to come onto the property to speak with employees for three hours a day, 120 days a year about health and safety issues, educational opportunities, medical treatment available to them, or or or or just to promote an ideological cause. Would would there be a different result?
",-0.2637222409248352
895,20-107,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1554.6,1635.16," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Thompson. I'm a bit mystified by some of the arguments here because it seems like you're asking us to reinvent the wheel, but it's not a new issue at least as I see it. We decided unanimously in 1956 how to balance property rights against union organizing rights in the Babcock case. And then, of course, in Lechmere, we reiterated that in Justice Thomas's opinion for the Court there. The Babcock briefs, if you go back into those, those are all about property rights against union organizing rights, and then Babcock considers that and and sets forth a rule. Now I think you you probably prevail under that rule, but I'm I'm curious why your argument is not as simple as Justice Clark's California Supreme Court Justice Clark's argument in his dissent in the '76 case that you cite where he just says, under Babcock, there's a rule, the Board's regulation here goes beyond the Babcock rule by permitting blanket access under private onto private property during worker working hours and access when alternative means of communications do, in fact, exist. The regulation is, therefore, unconstitutional. Why is it not as simple as that?
",0.4186098873615265
896,20-107,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1645.535,1708.715," Well, let me stop you right there. I I think they're doing constitutional avoidance and constitutional avoidance not to necessarily avoid a potentially unconstitutional but an unconstitutional unconstitutionality if the regulation were allowed to go beyond what the Court allowed in Babcock. So, in other words, it seems to me, especially if you go back into the briefs in Babcock, which are all about the Fifth Amendment not all about, but they talk a lot about the Fifth Amendment that then you read Babcock, it is interpreting the statute as informed by the Constitution and saying, given the constitutional status of the property rights, we're only going to allow this very limited intrusion, again, as Justice Clark says for the California Supreme Court, when alternative means of communication do, in fact, exist, then you can't go onto the property. Your response to that?
",0.6352398991584778
897,20-107,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1728.71,1763.02," But but now that it's here, isn't that the simple, easy response to the this case, which is we've already considered 65 years ago the balance of property rights against labor organizing. We set forth a very clear rule, and it was reiterated in Lechmere by Justice Thomas's majority opinion, and, you know, there's no reason to depart from that rule that we've seen. It provides expansive protection for property rights but not without the exception as articulated in Babcock, end of case.
",0.23548190295696259
898,20-107,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1804.605,1843.51," Mr. Thompson, so I I think that both sides, you and the Respondents, have line-drawing problems, so let me address your line-drawing problems. I think a lot of the questions, you know, starting with Justice Thomas's questions about easements and, you know, Justice Kavanaugh talking about Babcock and Lechmere, go to the question of when does something arise when does something become a physical taking such that the per se rule is triggered. So let me ask you this: What if California had a regulation that permitted union organizers to go onto the property of your client one hour a day, one day a year. Is that a taking subject to the per se rule?
",-0.5274139046669006
899,20-107,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1869.855,1900.47," Okay. So let me make sure that I understand the relevance then of the, you know, focus on the amount of time and the degree of intrusion. It's really not about whether property has been taken. It's about whether that's reflective of a government's intent to occupy or take, which is why that language in Portsmouth Harbor talks about if the intent behind a single shot was to assert control over the property, then the taking would be complete and that there's no question about the intent here because it was accomplished by regulation. Is that correct?
",-0.2278798520565033
900,20-107,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1937.195,1986.95," Okay. Well, let me ask you, I mean, I think the problems here are line-drawing and then the other problems are, as, you know, others of my colleagues have been suggesting, the the licensing regimes. And the Service Employees International Union has an amicus brief in which they say, well, listen, some of these justifications or some of these inspection regime regimes might be justified, and the Chamber of Commerce makes this point, as constitutional conditions on participation in the agriculture employment market, just as, say, for FDA licensing regimes, and inspections can be justified as legitimate exercises of conditions on the government's permitting a company to enter the pharmaceutical market. Why doesn't that rationale apply to your entry into the agricultural market?
",0.08281945437192917
901,20-107,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2201.585,2215.49," But what do you do if there's more than one union that wants access? I mean, it's not it's not at all unusual for unions to be competing for representation. So does each union gets its own 120 days?
",-0.4145803451538086
902,20-107,Clarence_Thomas_,2361.13,2425.295," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Mongan, the I'm quite interested in how related the inspection or the opportunity to be on private property has to do with the how related does it have to be to the business operation. For example, could you have the exact same requirement, except during non-business hours for the property to be available for training of the of the National Guard, for example, or the state police? Since it's since it's open property, just simply say for three hours a day, not more than 120 days a year, but certainly not to interfere with the business, the state police could train there?
",-0.2806186378002167
903,20-107,Clarence_Thomas_,2456.63,2502.66," I understand your point, but I'm really interested in why how this is different from the training, so I'm sorry, from the union's presence while workers are there. If the condition is that it the only two or three police officers can train during non-business hours and only in unoccupied portions of the property, how is that if that is closer to the line than the union coming onto property while workers are there and possibly even interfering with workers, how is the intrusion of the police officers different from that of the union organizers?
",-0.26907604932785034
904,20-107,Clarence_Thomas_,2528.02,2547.66," Well, let's say the state police are just there to use it for calisthenics and working out, and they're not firing guns, they're not meeting with the employees, and for and they are to remain as inconspicuous as possible. So why is that closer to the line than the union organizers?
",0.08929674327373505
905,20-107,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2569.46,2673.29," I I think the Petitioners are saying that whether this regulation is excessive or not is beside the point. That's a question of whether there's a regulatory taking and whether it went too far. This is the kind of taking that it, no matter what, requires compensation under the Fifth Amendment. It is a Fifth Amendment taking because it's a classical property interest. We have previously defined or sort of said that that kind of interest has to be a taking that is continuous and indefinite, like taking even an inch of somebody's apartment house to put up a CATV system or taking an easement for the beach. The virtue of their approach is that it's pretty clear, I think, because, otherwise, you get into the mess of saying, well, what about a year? Here, it's 4 percent of all the year's hours and 10 percent or 12 percent of all the daylight hours and and but it is not government coming in, it's a private person coming in. That's what they say. So what are the rules that distinguish an easement from not? I thought an easement, for example, ran with the land so that if it's no longer agricultural land but, rather, is a a steel mill, you can't transfer the easement. It doesn't exist anymore. Nobody can go on the property. There may be other characteristics. What are they, in your opinion, that distinguishes this case from a classical easement?
",0.5677527785301208
906,20-107,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2756.47,2786.335," As Justice Barrett said, both you and Mr. Thompson have line-drawing challenges here, so let's suppose that let's start out with a town taking an easement so that people in the town can walk over somebody's beachfront property to get to a public beach. You would concede that that's that that is a per se taking, right?
",-0.675262451171875
907,20-107,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2807.41,2820.45," well, that seems like a pretty simple that seems like a pretty simple question. What more would you need to know? The town says, we're we're going to take an easement over your property so that people can walk across your property to get from point A to point B.
",-0.3894975185394287
908,20-107,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2837.29,2855.895," All right. So suppose it's not suppose it doesn't apply 365 days a year. Suppose it's 364 days a year. Suppose it's 264 days a year. Suppose it's only on the Memorial Day, 4th of July, and Labor Day weekends. Different answer?

909,20-107,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2916.67,2938.06499995," Well, I mean, if you're not willing to concede that a a a permanent easement across somebody's property to get from point A to point B is a per se taking, then I don't know where your argument is going. And if you're not taking that position, then I really don't understand exactly where you're drawing the line. That's what I'm trying to get at.
",0.9861088395118713
910,20-107,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2956.345,2991.37," Counsel, I I I I'm following up on Justice Alito's question in part. I think you're saying that a per se rule should apply only to permanent and continuous physical invasions of a property right that's defined by state law, correct? So, if there was a permanent easement, you suggest it might be then a taking? A formal easement under California law?
",-1.1347240209579468
911,20-107,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2994.66,3052.645," All right. So let me let me take you a step further. If it's not, why should we be applying the Penn Central test? That test really doesn't fails to capture the significant interests in the right to exclude at stake in physical invasion cases. One of my colleagues was skeptical that there'd be much money involved in a situation like this one because I suspect that there's very little economic damage that's being done to a property in which there's intermittent inspections, and there's nothing that runs with the land or the business. I mean, if somebody buys the land and changes the business, then this Access Regulation has no applicability. That suggests to me that it has to be a different test. It can't be Penn Central.
",0.9725469946861267
912,20-107,Elena_Kagan_,3168.145,3212.71," General Mongan, I I have to admit I'm a little bit struggling to understand your argument, so can can can I just ask you to clarify this? As I understood what you said to Justice Alito, you said maybe a 365/24 taking of an easement, something that did, in fact, qualify as an easement, maybe that would be a per se taking. You sort of said maybe to that. But but, if this weren't if it was not a formal easement, you know, if there was not a discrete property interest, that the 365/24 possession of property would not qualify as a per se taking but instead would be resolved under Penn Central. Is that correct?
",-0.1273418515920639
913,20-107,Elena_Kagan_,3226.54,3258.285," Okay. Then then then you do get into the line-drawing problem. I mean, I guess I thought that you were getting rid of your line-drawing problem by just getting rid of Loretto, but but if if there if if you do acknowledge that, that a 365/24 ability to to intrude on property is a per se taking under Loretto and and and Nollan, then, you know, just ratcheting back from that, when does it stop being a per se taking?
",-0.10391179472208023
914,20-107,Elena_Kagan_,3334.64,3355.845," I mean, he has his problems, but I'm really trying to figure you know, figure out the answer to your problems. I I guess I just don't see even if you don't want to give me I can understand your not wanting to give me, oh, it's this number, but what's the principle that would enable you to set a line someplace short of 365 days?

915,20-107,Neil_Gorsuch_,3379.87,3414.96499995," Counsel, I I'd like to pick up on that. In in your brief, you did, I believe, concede that an easement identical to the one in Nollan but limited to daylight hours may qualify as a taking without regard to other factors. So I I I think that at least was your your point there. And if that if that's the case, then then let's just take a few things that move away from it a little bit. What if the state limited access to the easement to residents of a particular neighborhood? Would that take it out of a per se taking?
",-0.42637133598327637
916,20-107,Neil_Gorsuch_,3479.87,3492.2950001," So it's still per se still per se. And then, finally, what if what if the state had promised to remove the easement in the event that the residential property owner agreed to have it developed into a commercial one?
",-1.1529954671859741
917,20-107,Neil_Gorsuch_,3522.2,3538.02," So all of these are per se takings on your view, and as I understand it, the key difference is how many days are at issue? But daylight-only hours is enough, so half of the year is enough, I I assume then?

918,20-107,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3565.08500005,3638.85," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, General Mongan. The questions here have obviously been a lot about line-drawing, and I wanted to ask you, again, the flip side of what I was asking your friend on the other side. It seems to me our precedent in the labor organizing context has drawn the lines and has established a very narrow and very simple resolution for this case, and I want you to tell me why it's wrong or why you disagree with it. Babcock was obviously a statutory case but informed by the Constitution explicitly, as I read it, and the question was how much access will we allow to property under the statute, the NLRA, given the constitutional backdrop of property rights? And the decision seems to reflect the Court's understanding of the Constitution and how much protection there is for property rights, at page 112 of the decision, and basically says no access unless you can show that there are no alternative means of communication that exist, to simplify what it says there. Doesn't Babcock reflect a constitutional line-drawing that controls this case?
",0.09386655688285828
919,20-107,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3663.25,3684," But isn't that the problem right there? It took a different approach that intruded on on the property rights more than the Supreme Court, this Court, had allowed in Babcock? And isn't that you know, Justice Clark in the California Supreme Court decision pointed that out as the exact problem with the California regulation. It just went too far because it went beyond the NLRA?

920,20-107,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3691.36,3711.905," Put aside put aside the the nomenclature. The rule is you can't get access to the property when there are alternative means of communication. That's the Babcock rule about how to accommodate the Takings Clause and the labor organizing rights.
",-0.15411028265953064
921,20-107,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3744.76,3768.13," Exactly. And that's why I was pushing on them, that I don't understand why they're not relying on Babcock in the labor organizing context. They seem to want a much broader rule. But the the flip side of that is Babcock's a problem for you because, if we just followed that and said that reflected the balance of the constitutional rights, the constitutional right here, you would lose under Babcock, I think. I'll --

922,20-107,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3773.885,3810.35," General Mongan, so, obviously, this would not be an approach that would apply strictly to commercial property, as the hypotheticals based on Nollan suggest. So let me give you a hypothetical based on my personal residence. Let's imagine that it's situated on the corner of two busy streets and a city decides that it would be beneficial to allow people to protest on my lawn because it's so highly visible to the traffic that's passing by. But exactly like this one, you know, it says you can do it 120 days a year and three hours at a time just during rush hour. I take it, under your theory, that's not a per se taking, that would be subject to Penn Central.

I mean, in the reply brief, your friends on the other side point out that the Ninth Circuit and the Federal Circuit couldn't identify any Penn Central cases in which a court has found a taking where the diminution in value is less than 50 percent. And, surely, my property value hasn't decreased more than 50 percent as a result of the regulation I just described.

And so it's it's stacked in favor of regulations. But yet, you know, you're saying that in this particular context and I'm not sure I read Kaiser Aetna the same way that you do but you're saying that physical occupations are different. So, if physical occupations are different, why isn't the easier way to handle them the rule that we announced in Loretto, which is to say they're subject to a per se rule?

We keep saying there were some in the past that were discovered, but it's not clear that there are any new any new ones that haven't yet been discovered, but, you know, maybe, just maybe there might be a watershed rule out there that hasn't been discovered. It I mean, it sort of reminds me of something you see on some TV shows about the the quest for an animal that was thought to have become extinct, like the Tasmanian tiger, which was thought to have died out in a zoo in 1936, but every once in a while, deep in the forests of Tasmania, somebody sees a footprint in the mud or a howl in the night or some fleeting thing running by, and they say, a-ha, there still is one that exists. So, I mean, all of that is a wind-up to getting back to the question that Justice Thomas asked.

So I want to focus on the watershed inquiry, and in that inquiry, we've talked a lot about accuracy. And I think somebody previously asked you about your empirical evidence, and I'll just give you sort of my sense that the empirics here are sparse, maybe surprisingly sparse, as to how this unanimity requirement works with respect to what I take to be the ordinary meaning of ""accuracy,"" which is simply a reduction in the error rate in trials. And and so too it seems like one's intuition is not necessarily in your corner, that it might be that the unanimity rule allows more guilty people to go free than it than it stops innocent people from being convicted, or at least it's just not certain. So I I guess what I I'd like to ask you is whether your well, I mean, number one, do you just contest all of everything that I just said? But, number two, are are you talking about accuracy in some different sense? Your first sentence to us was, ""A verdict by a nonunanimous jury is no verdict at all."" And then you talked about a verdict can be inaccurate and unfair even though it leads to the right decision. And I guess what I'm asking is, are you talking about and do you think in our cases we've been talking about accuracy in some different sense than simply the reduction of errors in whatever direction?

How does that play into the Teague analysis and how can it play given that we've held Batson non- nonretroactive?

934,19-5807,Neil_Gorsuch_,1334.7,1386.87," Good morning, counsel. I'd like to start with your first argument, that Ramos did not announce a new rule. I I'm certainly sympathetic to that point of view. I believe the Court had, for well over 100 years, spoken about the unanimity requirement, as you know. But only a plurality agreed with me on that, and and there were a couple of joiners who thought that Apodaca was a precedent of the Court. A single justice speaking for himself defined existing precedent was nonetheless itself a precedent that we had to abide. And, of course, the dissenters took that point of view. How how how can we get to where you want us to go in that light? Do we account for the dissenters' position? Should we discount the dissenters' position? Even if we do discount that, what about the fact that the the majority itself had different views?

935,19-5807,Neil_Gorsuch_,1416.32,1437.845," So I'm I'm just just flesh that out for me a little bit more as to how you see this as not a rule, not a new rule. You know, certainly, Justice Ginsburg and and and Justice Breyer and I thought that's correct, but some of the other joiners even in the majority did not. What about them, if you if you have us discount the dissent?

936,19-5807,Neil_Gorsuch_,1510.065,1558.56," I surely hope you're right. With respect to the watershed route, your alternative route, you you you've gotten different variations of the question, but I I guess the way I'd I'd put it is Teague holds out this promise that there's going to be some watershed rule in the hands of Gideon as an example, which predates Teague, of course. But then, ever since, we haven't we haven't found a single one. Is is this a false promise? If it is, should we just admit it's a false promise? If it isn't a false promise, then what counts, what principle counts if DeStoff DeStefano doesn't count, Ring doesn't count, Batson doesn't count, Crawford doesn't count? Are we are we just who are we kidding and and what should we do about it?

As Justice Thomas and Justice Alito pointed out, we have a long line of cases, and you were just discussing with Justice Gorsuch post-Teague cases, such as Whorton about the Crawford rule and and many others where we have declined to apply a new rule retroactively on collateral. I'm also, though, concerned about the some of the pre-Teague cases which I think are on point here. The Chief Justice brought up DeStefano. You've you've equated Ramos to Gideon. The dissenters in DeStefano equated the jury trial right itself to Gideon, Justice Douglas and Justice Black, in their dissents, and I just want to give you an opportunity. The the the jury trial right not applying retroactively but the unanimous jury right applying retroactively on collateral review seems like an asymmetry.

938,19-5807,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1749.19,1806.74," Okay. On the Batson angle, as you know, in Ramos, I thought the Batson precedent was an important important one in thinking about how the nonunanimous jury actually operated in practice, and I think Batson is a a landmark opinion and one of the more important opinions in this Court's history in terms of ensuring that trials occur without racial discrimination. Yet, in Allen v. Hardy, we did not apply Batson retroactively. I know Justice Kagan referenced this with you. And that's, I guess, another asymmetry I'm concerned about here in in this case. And your distinction of of Allen v. Hardy would be?

And I agree with you the plurality there is supportive of you, but the opinion that that was decisive was the concurring opinion of Justice Powell and Justice Stevens, and they would have applied Burch retroactively only on direct to cases pending on direct, not on collateral.

Can you can you help me understand a a little bit more how your two prongs are distinct of what ""accuracy"" means?

941,19-5807,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1958.05,2013.265," You may not be able to identify a specific number, but, I mean, I think what Gideon was saying is that there is a significant chance that someone may have been convicted when he otherwise would not have been or when it was it reached the wrong result. I I guess I don't understand you know, you've got statistics saying that in Louisiana, as many unanimous verdict defendants have been exonerated or even more than those who had been convicted by nonunanimous juries, or that Oregon has a lower rate per capita of exonerations than those states that do have unanimous rights. So so what does it mean? Are we trying to ask whether juries wrongfully convicted someone because the majority saw the case in the wrong way and the and the one dissenter in the jury or the two dissenters in the jury were right? Can you just I'm just having trouble understanding what we're measuring.

I mean, Batson is an egregious example of racial contamination and discrimination in a jury that may well have affected the verdict. It seems to me that it would be speculation here too to think that the case would have come out differently with a unanimous jury.

It I think it's more accurate to say it overruled the decision rather than the opinion because it's not really clear what the what the opinion was. So that doesn't that discount the conclusion that it's a new decision if it's it's not the same as overruling a typical precedent?

Counsel, there's been some discussion about what we thought on this Court about Apodaca and the decision, et cetera, and there has been some confusion, but in the lower courts, do you know of any court that did not think that Apodaca permitted or perhaps allowed the use of nonunanimous juries or did not or actually did not think that Apodaca held that unanimous juries were permissible nonunanimous juries were permissible?

And the reason I think that's important is I I have always seen Teague as a kind of compromise here that, because of the Fourteenth Amendment applying to the states, our Court, this Court, the Supreme Court, was insisting upon somewhat fairer constitutional procedures, but they didn't want to let everyone out of prison, so they compromised. Now, if that's so, I'd like to know the total impact. Do you know anything about California about Puerto Rico and Oregon, or do you know where --

It says that it's retroactive because you have a six-man six-person jury has to be unanimous. It can't be 5 to 1. So, if a six-person person jury can't be 5 to 1 a 12-person can't be 10 to 2, and if the first was fundamental, why isn't the second?

You really haven't put any evidence that the that there aren't a significant number of people who have been wrongfully convicted because of the lack of unanimity. You say there some people benefitted and some people didn't. But what does it matter?

We cannot imagine that rule being viewed as anything less than fundamental to our entire system. That's number one. But, number two, if you're only talking about accuracy as, like, a reduction of error rate across the board, we wouldn't have that rule. We would have a preponderance standard.

In Ramos, Justice Gorsuch's opinion and mine as well talked about the history of nonunanimous juries, the linkage to racist origins. I know your point about the 1974 adoption. But I also looked at the how it was linked to the history of race-based peremptory strikes in Batson and how those two things had come from a from a similar place, a similar unfortunate place in our history, in the court in the country's history. And in this case, you know, there's a black defendant. The state uses its peremptory strikes to strike all but one black juror uses four of its six peremptories against black venire persons strikes five blacks for cause because several of them in part, for several of them had a family history of incarceration. And you're left with one black juror with a black defendant. And then you get a 11-to-1 verdict on the armed robbery count, the two kidnapping counts one of the armed robbery counts, two kidnapping counts, and the rape count. And the one juror is the black black woman, the black juror. This case seems like a classic example of what we were concerned about with the combination of peremptory challenges being used on the basis of race, maybe not to strike every juror but to strike all but one, and then the nonunanimous jury system complementing the the peremptory challenges. I know there wasn't a Batson successful Batson challenge in this case, but the facts of this case certainly seem troubling on how it all played out. I'll just give you an opportunity to react to that if you want.

So Justices Thomas and Gorsuch asked Mr. Belanger whether 2254(d) erected an independent bar, you know, regardless of what we say about Teague. We have an amicus brief saying that 24 2255(d)(1) supersedes Teague, so there are no exceptions, there is no watershed exception, and that's because 2254(d)(1) precludes a federal court from granting relief if the claim resulted if the state court adjudication resulted in a decision that was contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of sorry, permits granting relief only in that circumstance. And 2254(d)(1) makes no mention of watershed rules, perhaps reflecting Justice Alito's view that, you know, these are Tasmanian tigers and there are none left. And so, under 2254(d)(1), federal courts ought not be engaging in the Teague exception analysis. Do you have a position on that?

Isn't the right to a unanimous jury more important as a matter of factual accuracy than the right to a jury itself?

If it's an interpretation of the of the habeas statute, then don't we have to deal with 2254(d)?

And, second, you dispute I'd like you to answer both, so I'm going to give you your remaining time for that. You dispute that unanimity is necessary to increase accuracy in jury verdicts. But I can't think of any justification other than that for the unanimity requirement that the Constitution seeks has set. Our founders must have thought that that process enabled accuracy.

But, when I read the opinions on the majority side in Ramos, I think they say it absolutely is, you know, that it's basic in the exact same way that a beyond a reasonable doubt standard is basic, that it goes to the inherent characteristics of what in our system a jury has to do to find a defendant guilty. I mean, Ramos says that if you haven't been convicted by a unanimous jury, you really haven't been convicted at all. And so how could it be that a rule like that does not have retroactive effect?

None are likely to come forward, and it it is hard to see if if this doesn't qualify, which the founders thought was an essential component of the jury trial right, then it's pretty hard to see what might emerge that would qualify.

I want to talk to you about accuracy, and the first thing I'd like to ask is a follow-up to your dialogue with Justice Thomas. And and this is, I think, a point of clarification for me. You were distinguishing between factual accuracy and what I understood you to say would have been the more generous standard of considering the likelihood of wrongful conviction. What is the difference between the two of those, and how is the latter more generous than the former, if I understood you correctly?

So the whole point of this whole doctrine, I take it, is not to put a defendant to the trouble of going to a different state, where it's really unfair. I mean, unfairness underlies all these cases. And, here, they did send the car in. Maybe they didn't know it would get there. Maybe there is no causal connection. But they do do a lot of business with the same cars there. And so, since they do a lot of business with the same kinds of cars there, they have to be prepared to defend against this kind of suit. So what's unfair about it?

977,19-368,Stephen_G_Breyer_,698.38,712.11," On that, I thought that I thought that the other side says, no, no, we're talking about a case where the defendant does a lot of business of the same kind in the state. Just not this car, but a lot of other similar cars.

978,19-368,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,728.57,774.79," Let me pick up on a hypothetical that you have in your reply brief. I'll modify it slightly for purposes of of simplicity. So suppose a product is sold in a particular state where the manufacturer advertises this product as a very safe product, a person purchases it and is injured by the product. Would there be personal jurisdiction there, or would it be necessary for the injured individual to prove that the advertising as to the safety of this product was the proximate cause of the purchase of the product?
",-1.0619499683380127
979,19-368,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,816.97,844.91," So, if the person the person purchases it in, I don't know, Idaho, drives it to a person from Montana purchases it in Idaho because of advertising in Montana regarding the safety of this product and then is injured in in Montana, what would would would there be personal jurisdiction there?

980,19-368,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,869.99,910.99500005," Well, if we step back, and this is a little bit like Justice Thomas's question, we're talking about due process, which the international court court felt International Shoe court felt free to say, well, that just means fair play. If if that's what we're talking about, either fair play for Ford or what was at issue in Bristol Myers Squibb, which is a lawsuit in a suit that has in a state that has little connection with anything involved in the in the suit, what would be the justification for a ruling in your favor here?
",-0.4299995005130768
981,19-368,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1036.395,1070.395," All right. So let's assume that a Ford vehicle was designed in Michigan, manufactured in Kentucky, sold to a dealership in Kansas City, Missouri, but purchased by a resident of Kansas City. They saw a Ford advertisement in TV. The plaintiff wants to assert various claims for design defect, manufacturing defect, false advertising, and negligence. Is there any single state where the plaintiff could could allege all those torts?
",-1.0951985120773315
982,19-368,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1098.115,1136.43499995," So you would say any one contact would be enough, but how about if the airbag if the defect was in the airbag? Would Missouri still have jurisdiction over Ford or Kansas, you said Kansas would, if the defective airbag were not the original airbag but instead a new replacement airbag installed by a Ford dealership? And then take it a step further. Is it the airbag or is it an old sensor in the car that caused it? How do we determine jurisdiction then?

The computer catches on fire. I get injured. You're saying I can sue in New York, where I bought the the Apple computer, but I can't sue in California, where I live and where the injury took place. Is that right?

984,19-368,Elena_Kagan_,1243.095,1269.6," Yeah. So so, essentially, you're substituting what I think people have assumed in these product cases, which is, if if you are in a place and the injury takes place in a place because of a manufacturing defect or a design defect, you get to sue. You're saying, no, it doesn't really matter where the injury took took place; what matters is where the first sale of the product took place?

985,19-368,Elena_Kagan_,1297.83,1316.84," Okay. But you can also do it where it's manufactured, for example. Okay. Then that's notwithstanding that this company, and let's go just back to Ford now, it advertises, it sells, it services these automobiles in exactly the same way in these two states.

987,19-368,Neil_Gorsuch_,1389.31,1481.34499995," Good morning, Mr. Marotta. It seems to me this case really puts into sharp relief the difficulties our doctrinal tests have created. We've made a firm distinction between specific and general jurisdiction for many years. We say specific jurisdiction has to ""arise out of."" Everybody seems to know what that means. Nobody knows what ""relates to"" means, the other part of the test. And so I I guess I guess I want to take you back to first principles along the lines of Justice Thomas. What does due process require? I suppose one could say it's whatever fair play whatever we think fair play means, in which case you you might run into some of the troubles we've we've been hearing some of the questions about. But it could mean due process could mean a couple of other things. One, it could mean the law of the land. Are you being haled into court in accordance with the law of the land? And, surely, that that's met here, the state long-arm statute. No one contests that it reaches you. Or it might mean that, as originally understood, the Due Process Clause and the ideas behind the due process would not have allowed a defendant to be haled into court in these kinds of circumstances. I didn't see a lot in the briefs addressing that question, so it's really something I I wanted to ask you and and and your colleagues today about. Do you have anything you want to comment there?

Now he sells a product from Maine, let's say, take the hypothetical that the Chief Justice gave. And the person who bought it has never seen his advertising, though he advertises a lot. The person who bought it didn't use his dealer, though he even has some there. And you think, under those circumstances, he can bring his lawsuit. Is that right?

It is a a product that is produced in somewhat limited quantities by a person in, let's say, Maine, but advertised on the Internet. That's the only way anybody learns about it. And purchases are made over the Internet. Someone purchases it in another state and is injured in that state. Would there be jurisdiction?

So we are in we could perhaps decide this case within the contours of our existing cases because there's nothing particularly 21st century about what happened here. But we're in a strange situation where we are not purporting to apply what due process was understood to mean when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. We are applying a 1945 standard adopted by the Court when it put on its fair play hat and said this is fair play as we understand the world in 1945. But the world in 2020 is completely different. So you may just say, well, decide this on the basis of your your existing case law and not propose anything grander, but, if you have a solution to the bigger problems that have been framed by some of the questions, it would be interesting to hear it.

So, if I'm Ford and I come up with a special kind of pickup truck and I decide really the market for this pickup truck is the southeast part of America and I only advertise it there and I only sell it there, then, if somebody takes the pickup truck to Washington State and something happens, then you're saying I cannot sue you in Washington State.

It it it says we have this pickup truck and mostly we're going to market it in the southeast, but we can't say we do nothing in the northwest, you know, we do a little bit.

My understanding of our law is that federalism has become an at least equivalent concern in the due process cases as fairness. So how does that cut with respect to your theory?

1004,19-368,Neil_Gorsuch_,2952.62,3040.305," Good morning, Mr. Gupta. I think the Chief Justice and others have pointed out the difficulty of our purposeful availment test in an Internet age, and some of it was cabined by a rise out of when that had some causal link, but now we're blowing past that and we're adorning ""relate to"" to mean something more, which I I totally understand. And I get your same product test is a limiting way, though I think there there are issues there. What if, for example, Ford didn't sell Explorers in Montana, but the part that allegedly failed in the Explorer by your client in Montana is also sold by Ford in lots of other models in Montana. Which is the relevant product? Is it the Explorer or is it the part? And and I I foresee a lot of difficulties there, all of which, again, takes me back to, at least at least me, to these first principle questions. We seem to be blurring the line between specific and general jurisdiction. If specific jurisdiction says fair play, I I get that this seems like fair play, but then where is the limiting factor there? Do you have anything about the original meaning of the Due Process Clause that you want to argue here that might provide some helpful guidance?

1006,20-366,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,123.04,141.44," General, my first question goes to the very first point you raised. We expedited this case in light of the December 31 deadline for the Secretary to transmit the census to the President. Is that date still operative? Do you still need a decision by that date?
",-1.397534966468811
1007,20-366,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,197.76,224.12," On the standing question, if the Court doesn't intervene now before the Secretary transmits the information to the President, I don't know when the Court would be able to intervene. All all that would be left after that transmittal is the transmittal by the President to to the House. So, if if the injury can't be redressed at this point, when could it be?

",-1.3880138397216797
1011,20-366,Clarence_Thomas_,539.16,577.64," Well, it just seems to me that, you know, the I don't understand why you couldn't get the exact the President couldn't get the exact same advice outside of the context of a formal report with with separate numbers and then make his decision. But, beyond that, the Chief Justice asked you about the subset, subcategories of or subsets of illegal aliens. But could you give us your idea of what the President means generically by ""illegal alien""?
",-0.5356717109680176
1012,20-366,Stephen_G_Breyer_,602.8,732.16," Yes, thank you. I was also concerned with what Justice Thomas brought up, and so, to clear away some weeds from my mind, would you tell me where I missed this or if I'm right. We're looking at a statute, 141. A says the Secretary shall take a Decennial Census, okay? B says the tabulation of the population that he just took, as required for the apportionment of representatives, that tabulation shall be reported to the Secretary by the Secretary to the President. That's the report we're concerned about. That's the tabulation we're concerned about. And it is based on that, where you go to 2a, the President shall transmit a statement showing the whole number of persons for the purpose, again, of apportionment. So we're not interested in other ways. We're interested in this report, in this tabulation, under 141(b). Now, if I'm right so far, the President's order says I'll tell you why I want that. I want that because it's our policy that illegal aliens will not be included in the census. I can't tell you exactly what ones. It doesn't say that. It just says illegal aliens will not be included. And he asked for the report so he can do that. Now, if the Constitution forbids him to, or if the statutes forbid him to, subtract from the tabulation for purposes of the statement, if it forbids him to subtract those illegal aliens, or to the extent it does, the tabulation and the report are not the tabulation required for the apportionment of the census and, therefore, he cannot ask he cannot ask the Secretary for that report to contain that information. Right or wrong and, if wrong, why?

1013,20-366,Stephen_G_Breyer_,769.08,802.96," Well, it is not the information if it's unlawful that is required for the apportionment of rep the House of Representatives because it is illegal. Now whether it's illegal or not is a different question. All we have on that is about 40 briefs that show that the history, the language, the consequences, the purposes, and a bunch of other things argue against you, but you have arguments against that. But, if that side wins, then I don't see how the information he's requested could be the information required for the apportionment of representatives, quoting the statute.

And they're saying: Mr. Secretary, you cannot give to the President this requested information and also say that that piece of paper that you send him is the tabulation as required for the apportionment of representatives. It may be something else, but it isn't that. And that's what he's asked you to do, and that's what you're trying to do. And, Mr. Secretary, if it's illegal, you can't do it.

1016,20-366,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,916.72,1017.12," General Wall, if I can, I want to try to press you a little bit on some of the answers you gave to the Chief Justice because I find the posture of this case quite frustrating. It could be that we are dealing with a possibility that is quite important. It could be that this is much ado about very little. It depends on what the Census Bureau and the Department of Commerce are able to do. If I just take the numbers from the district court in D.C.'s opinion last week, they said that the the plaintiffs in that case were claiming that there are 10.5 million people in this country who would be counted as being here illegally. But, if you look at the smaller number of of those who are held in detention facilities, it's it's something like 60,000. The first number could easily change the apportionment of representatives. The second one, it's much more doubtful that it would change the apportionment of representatives. There are only 31 days left in the year. To exclude the 10.5 million seems to me a monumental task, to do that without sampling, to take 300 million plus names and determine individually for each of those people whether they are lawfully in the United States. And I would think you would be able to tell us whether that remains a realistic possibility at this point.
",0.471294641494751
1017,20-366,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,1097.44,1140.2," Well, before my time runs out, I I'm I have no expertise whatsoever in this area. I could understand if they say all we can determine is how many people are in detention facilities or subject to final orders of removal. If they're going for the bigger picture and trying to identify everybody who is in this country unlawfully, I don't see how that they can provide a partial answer to that. If they were to say, well, you know, we've done this for 200 million people, but we don't know about the 100 million plus additional people, there's no way an apportionment could be based on that, is there?
",1.0881235599517822
1018,20-366,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1193.6,1294.68," Yes. Mr. Wall, as I understand and read the memo, the President's memo, he says he intends to exclude every alien who does not have permission to be here in the United States. Now, yes, he limits this to where it's feasible to identify that, but right now his policy is, if I can identify them, no matter what the reason is for them being illegal an illegal alien, I'm going to exclude them from the census. Following up on Justice Alito's question, aren't those the very categories that you already say that we've been told there have been some of them who's in ICE is going to come by December 31, and then, by January 11, the Census Bureau says that it intends to provide the President with the information ""necessary to fully implement the Presidential Memorandum."" I'm quoting the Census Bureau. So, if I take that at its face, it means that the number's not going to be 60,000. The number intended is substantially large. And I think that was Justice Alito's point, which is the Census Bureau has been collecting data about undocumented immigrants from other agencies for over a year. I don't see how you can represent to us that you don't think it's going to be a substantial number.

1019,20-366,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1325.64,1382.32," Mr. Wall, I I'm a little bit questioning of that for the following reason: The Census Bureau already defines what residency is, where you're living as a snapshot date of April 1, 2020. Now, whether you're in a prison, in ICE detention, we're told by one of our amici that 57 percent of the people in detention will eventually be released to the United States either through asylum or through some other mechanism. So I am not sure how you can identify any class of immigrant that isn't living here in its traditional sense, that this is where they are, this is where they were on April 1 and where they intend to stay if they can find any way to do it.
",0.23478248715400696
1020,20-366,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1420.52,1474.16," Well, what you're saying is the memo says, I think anyone the Presidential memo says, I think anyone without papers should not be counted. Now you're saying: Well, maybe the President will limit that sub-category. But that's not what he's asking for. He's asking for all of those illegal aliens that can be unidentified. And wouldn't Heller defeat this argument that we shouldn't rule? In Heller, we knew that there were certain people who states could legitimately bar from possessing guns in their homes, but we didn't say because there's that subset we're not going to declare what the general law is. So why shouldn't we do the same thing here, you can't exclude illegal aliens may because they're undocumented?

As I read you, you're saying, well, yes, there's this small category of ICE detainees, that seems pretty feasible, but that's just tens of thousands of people. So how about a few others? As I understand it, there are almost 200,000 persons who are subject to final orders of removal. Will the Bureau be able to report on those?

1022,20-366,Elena_Kagan_,1602.84,1628.2," Okay. So what I'm what I'm getting from you is we can get very easily to 4 or 5 million people who you have extensive administrative records on, and you're saying, well, there's a matching problem. So I guess this goes back to Justice Alito's question. You're 30 days out. It seems to me you either know whether you can do matching or you don't know whether you can do matching. Why the uncertainty on this?
",-0.052216846495866776
1023,20-366,Elena_Kagan_,1655.36,1677.4," Can I ask you, before we go to the merits, Mr. Wall, how would a post-apportionment challenge of the kind you talked about earlier work? It seems to me that the time period, once it's post-apportionment, is very crunched. States have to do their own redistricting. How exactly does that work? What's the time line on it?
",-1.2796002626419067
1024,20-366,Elena_Kagan_,1721.36,1744.52," Do you think that given that you're uncertain when the report will go to the President this goes back to the Chief Justice's first question that there's something to be said for not following the expedate expedited procedures that that you asked us to follow and just sort of keeping this around in a normal way and you could tell us whether expedition was necessary when you knew?

1025,20-366,Neil_Gorsuch_,1782.2,1810.52," Good morning, Mr. Wall. I'd I'd I'd like you, just to press a little bit further, on what are the what are the practical difficulties and and and likelihood of actually being able to do the matching process with respect to various categories? It it it seems like the one common ground is the 10,000 or whatever number it is currently in ICE detention is something you think will will happen. Beyond that, can you give us any sense of the difficulties or likelihoods?
",-1.0966159105300903
1026,20-366,Neil_Gorsuch_,1862.32,1926.48," I I have a question in a in an entirely different direction. Your your colleagues on the other side pointed in a footnote, I believe it was, in their briefs, to the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of nine in the 1990s, which looks like it may have well repealed Section 2. And so are we arguing over the meaning of a statute that doesn't exist? I had hoped to get some response from the government on that in its reply brief but didn't see any. Perhaps I missed it. And what what is the government's view about the status of Section 2? New York suggests, well, maybe it is repealed, but to the extent the government wishes to comply with the repealed statute, it has to follow the repealed statute's terms, as one response. Another response is that that the only thing repealed were reports and this is a statement. Does the government have any views on any of that?
",-0.6432973742485046
1027,20-366,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2042.6,2110.12," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, General Wall. You you forcefully argue that there's too much uncertainty, that the dispute will become a concrete Article III controversy only after the President transmits the statement. But I want to button up some things on that to make sure we're on the same page and follow up a bit on what Justice Kagan was asking you. First of all, you're not saying, as to judicial review, not now, not ever. You're just saying not now as I understand it. But, as Justice Breyer indicated, the posture of this will change after the President transmits the statement, and there's a question about injunctive relief against the President. So I think you're saying that we can assume, as the Court has before, that the President would comply by a declaratory judgment requiring him to transmit calculations that include those non-citizens living living unlawfully within the country if we were to issue such an order after the President transmits the statement. Is that accurate?
",0.5429829955101013
1028,20-366,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2112.16,2155.48," Your argument for waiting is based on uncertainty, uncertainty, again, as Justice Kagan and the Chief Justice and Justice Alito were asking about the numbers, but one thing that was in the D D.C. opinion of Judge Katsas, joined by Judge Friedrich, was that it will be not possible to exclude all non-citizens living in unlawfully in the country because that would require the use of sampling, is what the opinion said, and that the memorandum, the Presidential Memorandum, rules out the possibility of using an unlawful method. Is that accurate, or what's your response to that?
",-0.5784839987754822
1029,20-366,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2189.32,2205.08," Well, is it possible to exclude is it possible to get the information to exclude all non-citizens living unlawfully in the country, or is it possible only to get information as to subsets at this point? You may not know the answer to that.
",-0.053264833986759186
1030,20-366,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2236.6,2292.32," And then, on the question of ripeness or standing, our our doctrine, as I see it, parts of the ripeness inquiry are really similar, if not identical, to parts of the standing inquiry if you look at the phrasing in cases like Ohio Forestry on ripeness and cases like Susan B. Anthony on standing. The key point, I think, is that the memorandum imposes no obligations on the plaintiffs to do anything at that at this point, unlike, for example, a typical agency regulation that might, say, impose some duties or requirements on the plaintiffs and we allow pre-enforcement challenges. We've called that lack of ripeness. We've called that no standing. Do you think it matters which we call it, and do you agree that the two inquiries overlap on that particular kind of analysis?

1031,20-366,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2327.08,2355.76," Good morning, General Wall. I'm going to let you talk about the merits for a minute here. You know, as Justice Breyer said, a lot of the historical evidence and longstanding practice really cuts against your position. And, you know, there's evidence that in the founding era, an inhabitant was a dweller who lives or resides in a place. You do have this Vattel quote that defines an inhabitant as a distinguished from a citizen, as a stranger who's permitted to settle and stay in the country. Do you think that Vattel quote is your best evidence?
",-0.35824522376060486
1032,20-366,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2414.4,2425.92," But, if if an undocumented person has been in the country for, say, 20 years, you know, even if illegally, as you say, why would some person not have a such a person not have a settled residence here?
",-0.45613574981689453
1033,20-366,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2532.04,2540.48," So it's just been an unexercised discretion; all along they could have been excluded from the sentence census, and the fact they had not been excluded before doesn't mean the President can't make the choice to do so now?
",0.23661881685256958
1034,20-366,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2829.2,2851.72," Let's suppose let's suppose that the Secretary conducts the census and prepares the tabulation exactly as you would have it and puts that in an envelope to send to the President, but it also, in a separate envelope, puts information on the number of illegal aliens and he sends both of those envelopes to the President. Is that fine with you?
",-1.1530214548110962
1035,20-366,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2881.48,2902.08," the the the President, I would assume, is then free to report to the Congress information for the apportionment, and he can it's okay, he can do the math. He can take what the census that the Secretary has transmitted, as you would have it, and subtract the number of illegal aliens or subcategories and use that information, can't he?
",-0.4849402904510498
1036,20-366,Clarence_Thomas_,2929.32,2951.08," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. General Underwood, I'm a little confused. The did I understand you to say that if the Census Bureau sent the information in a separate envelope, that would be fine, at least if if it was labeled not the 1 Section 141 report?
",-0.5292920470237732
1037,20-366,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3017.76,3046.56," Thank you. General Underwood, I think, are there not, many statutes which divide funds among the states on the basis of population, and then they say something like ""as shown by the most recent Decennial Census,"" and does that tie that to the 141(b) report? I think it does. Do you know any are there not many instances where it does?
",-0.7663833498954773
1038,20-366,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3164.68,3234.04," Thank you. I have two questions that are important to me. I hope I'm going to be able to squeeze them both in in my time. The first concerns your answer that it would be fine for the Secretary of Commerce to submit numbers that exclude illegal aliens if it was done in a separate document. Once you concede that, unless you are asking us to overrule what Franklin said about the President's directing the Secretary to reform the census, then I don't really understand where your argument is going. Suppose the suppose the tables were turned. Suppose the President wanted to count every single person who was in the United States on census day, but the Secretary of Commerce took it upon himself to give the President numbers that excluded every illegal alien. Do you think the President would then be unable to direct the Secretary of Commerce to reform those numbers and make them comply with the theory that the President accepted?
",0.04572097957134247
1039,20-366,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3249.92,3281.64," Yeah. Well, that goes to the substance of the of the issue, which I do want to get to, but if the Secretary once you concede that two documents are possible and that the President can ask the Secretary to reform the numbers that are sent to him, I don't understand why there isn't a why why the situation where both sets of figures are submitted in a single document is any different? It seems like a totally meaningless formality.
",0.3407837748527527
1040,20-366,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3320.68,3347.8," If I can if I can move on to my second my second point. I want to give you six categories of people and ask you to answer yes or no, to the extent you can, whether you think each of these people in each of these categories must be counted for apportionment purposes. First category is a foreign diplomat who is posted here for three years?
",-1.2825807332992554
1041,20-366,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3385.72,3421.32," General, I see this as being very similar to Franklin because I think you're arguing, and I think the Solicitor General agreed, that the President has to use only the numbers that are given to him by the Secretary. If the Secretary gives him illegal numbers to exclude, then he can't use an outside report to exclude those people from the apportionment. Is that correct?
",-0.36505961418151855
1042,20-366,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3435.76,3456.08," And so, if it is illegal for him to exclude illegal aliens sorry for for for that then we can do exactly what we said could be done previously, which is to order the Secretary not to give the President illegal numbers, correct?
",-0.7899957299232483
1043,20-366,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3458,3479.4," So that's your point, which is, if he's going to tabulate and exclude illegal aliens, we have to decide as a matter of law whether the word ""person,"" as used in the statute and Constitution, who live here permits the exclusion of illegal aliens, correct? That's the legal question?
",-0.9577469229698181
1044,20-366,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3482.24,3523.76," If he later decides that he wants a particular category of people to be excluded who are illegal aliens, then he gives a memo to the Census Secretary earlier that says: This category, I think, should not be here for these reasons. And if the Secretary says, I'll give you those numbers, then we would have an identical Franklin decision where they could come in and sue and say to the Secretary: No, you shouldn't permit those illegal aliens, or yes, you should, whatever the answer is, correct?
",-0.0011315126903355122
1045,20-366,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3525.96,3547.64," And that's what's missing here, which is the President is asking to exclude to give numbers on the category of illegal illegal aliens that of any kind, and some of those numbers legitimately cannot be included; that's your argument, correct?
",-0.7944460511207581
1046,20-366,Elena_Kagan_,3548.48,3631," General Underwood, if I could take you back to the standing question. This is the way I understood what came out of General Wall's minutes. You the government has tons of records on tons of people. I mean, we're not just talking about ICE detainees. By the time you think about DACA recipients and people in removal proceedings and a number of other categories, you easily get over 4 million people. But General Wall says that that's not the problem. The problem is a matching problem. And, essentially, the the Department has not yet sort of gone through this process of trying to match those numbers with the answers to the census questionnaire. Now I don't really quite understand how that process works, so I'm wondering, if you do, if you can tell me whether you think it's credible that they, the Census Bureau, at this point would not know approximately how many people they'll be able to exclude of all the people that they have administrative records on. And I guess the second question would be, is that what we should be focused on, or is that an unimportant question?
",0.37824583053588867
1047,20-366,Neil_Gorsuch_,3744.5,3771," As I understand it, they can't use statistical sampling, so they're going to have to match their detention records or their docket records against the actual enumeration in in in the census. And at the present, they tell us that they might not be able to to do more than maybe the aliens in ICE detention facilities, which would be in the tens of thousands and perhaps not affect any apportionment at all.
",0.05617416277527809
1048,20-366,Neil_Gorsuch_,3800,3820.08," But but, Ms. Underwood, I guess my question is, you know, you you you concede that it's speculative as to how much they're going to be able to do. And once we've once we're in that world, then it's speculative whether there's going to be any effect on the apportionment. And and in that world, we have a standing problem, don't we?
",-0.16365523636341095
1049,20-366,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3859,3904," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning and welcome, General Underwood. As Justice Barrett's questioning illuminated, I think, you have advanced forceful constitutional and statutory arguments on the merits of a categorical exclusion of all unlawful non-citizens. But I'm not sure that's going to be the dispute, and so I want to explore that. If we said now, as you want us to say, that the Secretary and the President cannot exclude all non-citizens living here unlawfully, suppose we say that, and then the President excludes not all but some subsets, then we'll be right back here with litigation, correct?
",0.22530612349510193
1050,20-366,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3916,3932.1," I'm sorry to interrupt couldn't he then substitute a new policy consistent with the decision on all by saying we're going to exclude some subsets, and then there will be litigation on that and we'll be right back here, which is --
",-0.5727239847183228
1051,20-366,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3939.7,3988," Well, I think it's sorry to interrupt but I think the Solicitor General has indicated it's going to be very difficult, if not impossible, to exclude all. And I guess I'm wondering then, it seems like part of this is and you you've acknowledged this forthrightly is the difficulty of an injunction against the President if we wait to post-apportionment but or post-transmission, but the President, we've assumed in the past, would comply with a declaratory judgment. We've said that. The Solicitor General confirmed that today. Does does that eliminate the problem that has forced or encouraged you to bring this litigation now?
",0.5074447989463806
1052,20-366,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4016.5,4052.6," Good morning. I have one question that's a follow-up to Justice Kavanaugh's question, and that has to do with the feasibility of counting all of these categories of illegal aliens. If, as General Wall said, the President and the Secretary of Commerce are only able to identify certain categories and, as Justice Kavanaugh said, if that means that there would be litigation on a case-by-case basis about whether such categories should be in or out, doesn't that cut in favor of waiting, that maybe there's no injury here because we're not really sure what the contours of the decision would be?
",-0.5652099251747131
1053,20-366,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4117.5,4142.2," But what if what if we say that he cannot categorically exclude all illegal aliens? He says, fine, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to count everyone who's in an ICE detention facility, everyone who's in removal proceedings, and maybe say all DACA recipients. But I agree, you know, I have reasons for thinking each of these don't satisfy the inhabitancy requirement. Wouldn't you just be back litigating those specific issues?
",0.6462532877922058
1054,20-366,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,4286,4313," Mr. Ho, what is the problem with post-apportionment litigation? Right now, as the questions have shown, we don't know what the Secretary's going to do. We don't know what the President is going to do. We don't know how many aliens will be excluded. We don't know what the effect of that will be on apportionment. All these questions would be resolved if we wait until the apportionment takes place. So why aren't we better advised to do that?
",0.4892485737800598
1055,20-366,Clarence_Thomas_,4384.32,4414," Yes, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Ho, if the additional information would be beneficial in a few weeks, wouldn't it be beneficial to actually resolving this case? As the questioning seems seems to suggest, there's some difficulty in assessing exactly what information will be available and what that information will be.
",-0.6650474667549133
1056,20-366,Clarence_Thomas_,4456,4473," Well, it I think it would be the I think your argument would be that the implementation of a categorical policy would be unlawful, but what I'm hearing is that we don't exactly know which category or subcategory will be excluded.

1057,20-366,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4632,4652.5," I'm going to try to see if I can get you to answer Justice Breyer's question. Last term, we had a case involving an alien, Mr. Thuraissigiam, who crossed the border unlawfully and was almost immediately apprehended and then placed in detention. Would he have to be counted?
",-0.9193578362464905
1058,20-366,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4821.76,4855," to have all right. Now can we go back to the the question that seems to be at the nub of what many of my colleagues are asking about, which is can and should we rule that simply that not counting illegal aliens because they're undocumented, that that is a violation of the statute and the Constitution? Is that enough relief to you?
",-0.21899504959583282
1059,20-366,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4874.64,4893.56," Assume I even agree with that, however. Could would that just mean what does that mean practically? Does the what does the Secretary do? He doesn't send anything? How about if the President comes back and says just send it to me on these categories? What happens then?
",-0.9966240525245667
1060,20-366,Elena_Kagan_,4924.76,4958.08," Mr. Ho, I guess I would like you to to comment on on General Wall's view of the feasibility of the matching process, you know, whether you have any insight into that, into how the process works, and and maybe as part of that, whether you have any insight into the question of why it is that the government knows now that it can do that matching with respect to the ICE detainees but isn't sure it can do that matching with respect to categories of people for whom it has equally good administrative records.
",-0.9730218052864075
1061,20-366,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,5047.88,5122.44," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Ho. First, I want to make one point in response to something General Underwood said, and I'm hope hoping the Solicitor General can address this on reply, about the declaratory judgment after apportionment, who that would be addressed to and how that would work. That's something that I would appreciate more from the Solicitor General on but not going to be able to ask at that point. As to as to you, I want to ask you about your point that we should rule now because the memo expresses the intent to exclude non-citizens who are here unlawfully to the maximum extent under law, is what you said, and you quoted that a couple times. You also referenced I think this is important the memorandum says feasible. And I think the argument has revealed, as did the briefs, but the argument even more clearly, it's going to be very difficult it's not going to be particularly feasible to exclude all of the non-citizens. We're going to be left with categories. How how do we think about feasibility?
",-0.20187093317508698
1062,20-366,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5249.52,5262.88," I didn't I didn't mean that the lawfulness of whatever the new memorandum said would be determined. I just meant that there would be nothing unlawful about his switching positions and articulating a new rationale for why certain categories of illegal aliens were excluded.
",0.9962145686149597
1063,20-366,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5283.8,5295.44," It would be it would be a different question. As you told Justice Kavanaugh, that would be a bridge we would have to cross later, right? Like, if he said, listen, it's just not feasible, we haven't been able to get the information, so this is why we're going to exclude those in ICE detention facilities, say?
",0.5074909329414368
1064,20-366,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5309.28,5325.2," Right, but that but that excuse me, Mr. Ho but, in that instance, you're saying that the policy itself would be unlawful, but you're not taking the position that he is precluded at this point from changing positions and issuing a new policy, the lawfulness of which would be a separate question?
",-0.49962523579597473
1065,19-930,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,134.64500005,151.37," Counsel, I I think I heard you say that you're asking that the notice be set aside. But maybe it's a technical matter, but that's not actually what you're asking. You're asking for an injunction against the enforcement of the notice. Does that make a difference?
",0.03996412828564644
1066,19-930,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,239.145,263.7," you certainly have to agree that, under its normal meaning, that that your your approach would, in fact, restrain the assessment or collection, right? It would certainly make it would certainly be an impediment to just that. That's the purpose that's the significance, I suppose, of your asking for an injunction.

1068,19-930,Stephen_G_Breyer_,435.775,483.13499995," I'm thinking of your having some way of getting their decision reviewed. Why can't you state your underlying claim, which is: You have to, IRS, promulgate this kind of rule, reporting requirement, only after having a rulemaking. So what you do is you file a piece of paper saying give us a rulemaking. And if they say no, you go to court and say: That decision was arbitrary, capricious, and abuse of discretion because they have no other way of doing what they want to do except through a rulemaking.

1070,19-930,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,661.915,680.52," Well, there seem to be several factors packed into the answer that you just gave. If it's if purpose is what is key, I'm not quite sure how a court can separate out the purposes that are at issue in a situation like this.

1071,19-930,Sonia_Sotomayor_,715.29,749.58499995," Counsel, I go back to your answer to the answer you gave to the Chief Justice. Your complaint asks to declare the notice invalid and, hence, a declaration that penalties can't be assessed against you. I don't see how you get around our cases Bailey, Alexander, and several other cases where we have said a taxpayer can't plead around the AIA simply by alleging the tax is unlawful.
",-0.1112341582775116
1072,19-930,Sonia_Sotomayor_,761.63,783.04," So what's the the consequence of enforcing the notice is that you don't have to report and the government can't collect taxes. If you're talking about looking at practical consequences, your failure to provide the notice results in a tax.

1074,19-930,Sonia_Sotomayor_,854.56,872.16500005," Counsel, that seems that seems like a worse case for your argument. It would seem to me that if a lawsuit stops the IRS from collecting taxes from you, that that's exactly what the Anti-Injunction Act was intended to prohibit.

1075,19-930,Elena_Kagan_,900.53,929.435," Mr. Norris, I'm wondering if you could help me out on the role that South Carolina v. Regan plays in your argument. As I understood it coming into this argument, what you were saying is that even if I'm with the government sort of every step of the way as to what the AIA requires, that there's still a kind of back-end equitable exception that's created by that case. Is is that what you're saying, or are you saying something different?
",-0.8189542889595032
1076,19-930,Elena_Kagan_,984.7,1005.51499995," You're not suggesting that that that that is the rationale that's used in South Carolina v. Regan, are you? To me, the rationale that is used in that case is really equitable in nature. It doesn't refer to the statute. It doesn't ask about how we should interpret the statute. It just says this seems fair to us.

1077,19-930,Elena_Kagan_,1032.3,1062.345," And and and I guess this goes back to Justice Breyer's question, but it seems to me that your suit is different from Regan in two ways. One is that there was a constitutional claim there, and the second was that the Court kept on saying in Regan there's absolutely no alternative remedy available. It's not just a a favored alternative. I mean, there's no alternative remedy remedy. Do you take issue with either of those two differences?

1078,19-930,Neil_Gorsuch_,1093.76,1129.42," Good morning, Mr. Norris. I'd like to get your response or thoughts on Judge Sutton's concurrence in the denial of rehearing en banc, and he expressed one concern that, given the fact that the Anti-Injunction Act and Tax Injunction Act are so often interpreted in parallel, that by vindicating a taxpayer federal taxpayer's interests today, we might slight state sovereign concerns tomorrow, creating the risk that too much haste in stopping one abuse of power might open the door to another. I'd like your thoughts in response to that.

1079,19-930,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1217.295,1316.09," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, counsel. I wanted to give you my thought about how I'm looking at this and get your reaction. So, on the tax, I see this as a Subchapter 68 penalty that, therefore, qualifies as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. On Direct Marketing, it seems to me that that's arguably distinct because the penalty there was not a tax. Here, it is so defined as a tax and, therefore, comes within the scope of the Anti-Injunction Act. Then we get to the question and there's and there's other questions but the regulatory tax question, the Bob Jones and Alexander cases, and I want to get your reaction to this, which is I think reading those cases as they are poses a problem for you, but I'm not sure those cases are should be read for all they're worth. In other words, I'm wondering whether those cases we should back away from some of the implications of those cases for challenges to regulatory taxes for the reasons, some of the reasons you've given here, that it seems somewhat unfair, as it did even in those cases, somewhat unfair to force someone to go through the process that you're talking about here. So should we back away from Bob Jones and Alexander? How would we do that best without flat-out overruling them, or or should we go that far?
",-0.08536935597658157
1080,19-930,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1348.635,1364.78," But isn't isn't that, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, just a pleading exercise of how you frame it in your complaint? I'm challenging actually the regulatory part of the regulatory tax, as opposed to the enforcement of the liability itself?
",-0.5328081250190735
1081,19-930,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1388.59,1403.01," Well, it's a reg a regulation that's enforced by a penalty, so it is regulatory, a reporting requirement enforced by a penalty that in turn Congress has defined as a tax. So it does seem like a regulatory tax in that sense.

1082,19-930,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1432.34,1475.675," I want to follow up on Justice Alito's question. He asked you to state a test, essentially, to help us decide, you know, when something falls within the AIA and not. And, you know, the government's approach in thinking about why this is different from Direct Marketing is pretty straightforward. If it's called a tax, you know, Congress put this it called it a tax even though it's a penalty, it called it a tax, which seems to indicate Congress's desire to bring it within the AIA. But you're saying it's more it's more subtle than that, it's more complicated, you know, this is we can't we don't have a choice of just paying it and then seeking a refund later. So could you be a little bit more specific than you were with Justice Alito of what test do we use to figure out if it's within the AIA or not?
",0.023204930126667023
1083,19-930,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1537.995,1563.315," Would it be cleaner for us to go the Regan route but maybe, you know, phrase it this way, that this is covered by the AIA; however, because you would have to incur criminal penalties in in in order to sue, that you have no adequate alternative remedy, so even though the AIA applies, it doesn't bar your suit? Would you be satisfied with that approach?

1084,19-930,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1755.73,1803.37499995," Mr. Mr. Bond, I think Direct Marketing is a a real problem for you, except you have one big answer to it, which is that that that case that case did not involve a tax penalty and this one does. So I'm curious about how much weight you think that can can hold. If if Congress passed a law saying that there's a one dollar tax penalty for the violation of any IRS regulation, does that mean that there would be no pre-enforcement review at all for any tax regulation?
",-0.26011568307876587
1085,19-930,Clarence_Thomas_,2063.12,2084.6," Well, normally, when you think of taxes, Mr. Bond, you think of a tax liability or a tax based on some business activity or income-generating activity, recordkeeping related to that activity. Where where's the income here and where is the tax liability?
",-1.599562406539917
1086,19-930,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2144.78999995,2209.935," Well, I think their point or a point is the Lincoln's point. I mean, calling something a tax doesn't make it one. There are still differences. And one of the differences, they say, is this: If the IRS tells me I owe some money, I pay it, but I can get it back. If the IRS if it if it's illegal. If the IRS here tells me spend $100,000 gathering this information and give it to them, I can't get that money back. I can't declare it illegal. There's no way to do it. There's no way to do it. I have to keep doing it year after year. Of course, I'll have to follow it. I'm not going to violate it. So that's a big difference. And normally we presume there is some method of getting judicial review for an action requiring me to do something by the government when that action is not lawful. So what's the way?
",1.4784389734268188
1087,19-930,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2241.99,2266.66," That is quite a lot of money. They don't want to risk the vast what they think of as a vast amount of money, so they won't pay the penalty. They don't want to pay the penalty. They want to follow it. So you mean, if they follow the rule, they can say we're doing it under protest and then file to get back a penalty they've never paid? I'm missing something.
",1.1558111906051636
1088,19-930,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2284.44,2310.44," I'm not saying it's not a tax. I'm simply asking how do they get judicial review without paying the tax the penalty, which I'll call a tax, how do they get judicial review of the lawfulness of the order that says or the report that says give us the information? How do they do it?
",-0.14806713163852692
1089,19-930,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2412.21,2444.84," Well, why is it not a willful violation? Under Cheek, it's certainly willful. They say, look, I understand that under this guidance and under IRS regulations I'm required to do this, but I sincerely believe that it's unlawful. Isn't that exactly the situation in Cheek, where somebody says I'm not going to file a tax return, although I know that the Internal Revenue Code requires me to file a tax return, but I sincerely believe that the Internal Revenue Code and the Internal Revenue Service are unconstitutional. I don't see the difference.

Do you have any idea how many laws there are like that?

1091,19-930,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2649.15,2700.765," All right. But could you hold on, counsel? The reason I'm asking this question is is something that Justice Breyer was getting at, which is, if they if they give you the information you need, they may have spent $50,000, but they don't need to pay the tax. And we never have said that that someone has to spend money to not pay a tax they don't owe. Does that make any sense to you? They can never get that money back if they if they give you the information or if they don't give you the information.

That I see less I less I see less problem for for them getting the $50,000 back because, you're right, to prepare for disclosure, we all spend money and we never get it back if we didn't have to make it. But the idea is that committing the crime, they would have to fail to pay the tax and then pay this enormous amount more because they thought they were legitimately entitled not to provide you with the information.

1093,19-930,Elena_Kagan_,2801.24,2853.895," Mr. Bond, I'd like to talk to you about this language ""for the purpose of."" You said in one of your prior answers that the key to that language is we should look at the relief requested. And that seems reasonable enough. The only problem is I'm not sure it really helps you here. If I think about this lawsuit, it seems to me that the relief that's being requested is the invalidation of a reporting requirement. Now it's true that if it's successful in invalidating a reporting requirement, then you don't get to enforce that reporting requirement through a tax penalty. But the more simple way of thinking about this suit, and I think truly what plaintiffs here are doing, is to say they're trying to invalidate a demand that they disclose information. So how does that fit under the AIA?
",0.18325139582157135
1094,19-930,Elena_Kagan_,2873.03,2887.2," Well, suppose that they that they wrote a complaint with my views in mind and they just said this is what we're seeking; we're seeking to invalidate the reporting requirement. So does that fall under the AIA or not?
",-0.7493539452552795
1095,19-930,Elena_Kagan_,2900.25,2937.355," I I guess what I'm asking is, isn't the tax penalty here completely derivative and what they're really seeking is what they're objecting to, what they have problems with, is the demand that they disclose information? And remember that that demand is backed up not only by the tax penalty but also by a provision that allows criminal penalties, you know, put you in jail, fine you. So why why shouldn't we understand that that's an independent regulatory requirement, independent of the tax that they're objecting to, so it's not for the purpose of stopping a tax?
",0.6916688084602356
1096,19-930,Elena_Kagan_,2947.82,2961.61," I mean, I I think that we're just you know, that I think it's not. It's invalidating the notice. That's the relief, invalidating the notice. And it's true, you'll never be able to enforce an invalid notice, but that's not the essential purport of the suit.
",1.0387393236160278
1097,19-930,Elena_Kagan_,2977.65,3001.11999995," It may or may not be the real-world reason. I mean, suppose that the penalty here was five dollars, you know. Congress just put this tax penalty in to try to make sure that it was put under the AIA. So the real purpose is not to avoid the five dollars; the real purpose is to avoid hiring a lawyer and spending all the money to disclose information that you want to keep secret.

1098,19-930,Neil_Gorsuch_,3021.135,3078.18," Good morning, Mr. Bond. The APA was promised as a solution to the growing power of administrative agencies over the national economy. And the promise was, in part, that agencies would have to follow certain basic due process requirements like telling the public in advance what it intends to do and giving them an opportunity to comment. Today, of course, the IRS regulates enormous swaths of the national economy, from our medical care to our pensions, to the entire nonprofit sector, a lot of the educational sector, child care. And some estimate that the IRS today fails to comply with notice-and-comment requirements of the APA about 40 percent of the time. Should we be concerned?

",-0.4583565592765808
1100,19-930,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3185.515,3347.535," Thank you. And good afternoon, Mr. Bond. I'm going to tell you where I'm I think I'm with you and where I think I have a problem. On the text of the Anti-Injunction Act, I think you have a strong argument, Subchapter 68 and how that fits here. This penalty is designated a tax; therefore, it fits within the AIA. Direct Marketing, I think you have a good point. That was not subject that penalty was not denominated a tax and, therefore, the reason the two cases would be different is that the text of the statutes is different. You make a good point there, I think. In terms of the Regan point, how you would do this, you say you file a letter objecting to it, and you then have post- you have proceedings after the IRS assesses the penalty. That all makes sense to me as well. The criminal point, Justice Alito's point, you just said the Court could flat-out say that it's not a willful violation when you're challenging the reporting requirement being unlawful. So that we could we could say that. Here's where I think I have a concern: On Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander, those cases, you were having a discussion with Justice Kagan, either/or, are you challenging the regulatory aspect of this or the reporting aspect of this, or are you challenging the tax aspect? I think you're challenging both as a plaintiff really. And what Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander seem to say and this supports you is that when you're doing that, you have to go the AIA applies. And I I agree with you that those cases support you. But I also think Justice Gorsuch makes a very good point that the current philosophy that's those cases are from a different era. The current philosophy of challenging administrative action is different, as the Chief Justice said, with presumptions. And, here, where I really think Bailey and Bob Jones and Alexander may be different is when the penalties are so high if you lose. In other words, you have to bet, and if you bet and lose, penalties are so high that it's going to deter you from challenging the regulatory or reporting aspect in the first place. So the bottom long-wind up, bottom-line question. Shouldn't as a matter of fairness, modern era of administrative law, presumptions, shouldn't we carve out an exception from Bob Jones, Alexander, Bailey, when the penalties for trying to challenge something are so high that it's going to be coercive and effectively deter you from bringing this kind of challenge in the first place?
",0.4336406886577606
1101,19-930,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3406.945,3451.45," Mr. Bond, earlier you said and you say in your brief that something like the, you know, tax penalties associated with the EPA's fuel standards might be too far downstream to come within this. What is the test for that? I mean, I understand you articulated some of the differences, that this is, you know, housed in another agency but also enforced by these, you know, penalties that are considered taxes. I mean, otherwise you have a pretty bright line. If it's called a tax, then the AIA applies. If it's called a penalty, it's not. So, if you're willing to say that there should be some exception or some carveout in that context, like the EPA's fuel standards requirement, well, what would it be and why should we go with a bright line in this circumstance?

But you fight the declaring codes because there are multiple ways of declaring as well. Apple has a different way of declaring the same functions. They spent the billions of dollars necessary.

If if I understand the conversation so far, you are moving past, rather rapidly, the the primary argument in your brief that the code just simply isn't copyrightable. And I I I think that's probably a wise move given the fact that 101 says computer programs, including statements or instructions, in order to bring about a certain result, may be copyrighted. We might not think otherwise that it should be, but there it is. And, normally, the the specific instruction there in 101 would govern the more general idea-expression dichotomy in 102.

What do we do about the the fact that the other competitors, Apple, Microsoft, who I know is one of your amici, have, in fact, been able to come up with phones that work just fine without engaging in this kind of copying?

1120,18-956,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1787.43,1817.345," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Goldstein. To the extent you're still making the method of operation argument, the other side and the solicitor general say that declaring code is a method of operation only in the same sense that computer programs as a whole are methods of operation and that, therefore, your method of operation argument would swallow the protection for computer programs. Your response to that?
",-0.8289024233818054
1121,18-956,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1845.535,1872.945," On your merger argument, one concern that has been raised already is the timing issue. Another concern that I want you to respond to is that it seems to define the relevant idea in terms of what you copy. You're not allowed to copy a song just because it's the only way to express that song. Why is that principle not at play here?
",-0.2276555895805359
1122,18-956,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1920.8,1968.145," One of the points in some of the amicus briefs, and I want to compliment the briefing of the parties and all the amicus briefs, which have been enormously helpful, of the 83 computer scientists is that the sky will fall, in essence, if we rule against you in this case, threaten significant disruption. One question I had about that, though, is the Federal Circuit ruled in 2014, this Court denied cert in 2015 on the first issue. I'm not aware that the sky has fallen in the last five or six years with that ruling on the books. I know it's different if we rule here, but can you respond to that?

1123,18-956,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2230.465,2276.89," Mr. Rosenkranz, let's say you want to open a restaurant. You've got a great new chef. He's got great new dishes. And you say: Well, we've got to figure out what the menu should look like. You know, of course, you're going to have, you know, appetizers first, then entrees, and then desserts. Now you shouldn't have to worry about whether that organization is copyrighted. And I think Mr. Goldstein is saying that that's what's going on on here. Every restaurant organizes its menu that way, and you don't want to discourage people from opening it because they're going to have to spend their own time trying to figure out what the menu should look like. Why isn't that exactly what Google is saying here?

Well, what choice did they have without having to spend billions of dollars, which would be wasteful and impede the development of the high-tech business?

1125,18-956,Clarence_Thomas_,2512.83500005,2534.86," You argue that you seem to argue, in any case, that Google's use was not transformative because the use of declaring code operates in Android the same way it operates in Java. What would, in your way of thinking, transformative look like in the context of a computer code?
",-0.9685916304588318
1126,18-956,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2603.21,2754.465," All right. Please assume with me the following: Assume that the what you read, the computer computer programs which do something, after all, are copyrightable, but then it says methods of operation are not, whether they're computer programs or not. The problem for us is, is this more like Baker v. Selden, where they said the accounting is not, it's a method of operation? Or is it more like an ordinary computer program? All right. Now what I got out of reading through this very good briefing is, look, Java's people divided the universe of tasks, of which there are billions, in a certain way. All the things that tell the computer to do one of those things, we'll do. But that which tells the computer which to do, that's the declaration. Here is what it's like. It's like, as Judge Boudin said, the QWERTY keyboard. You didn't have to have a QWERTY keyboard on typewriters at the beginning, but, my God, if you let somebody have a copyright on that now, they would control all typewriters, which really has nothing to do with copyright. Or it's like switchboards on old-fashioned telephone systems. You could have done it in 1,000 ways. But, once you did it, all those operators across the world learned that system, and you don't want to give a copyright holder a monopoly of hmm telephone systems. Or it's like, to use the Chief Justice's example, a chef who figures out brilliant ways of mixing spices and then putting the spices for this and that in a certain order on a shelf, and then he writes something that tells you which shelf to go to and which shelf to pick out and which spice to pick out for which dish. Now all those things are somewhat ordinary programs, but they also are doing something. They're giving you an instruction as to how to call up those programs that reflect Java's organization. And at this point in time, it's really tough, just like the QWERTY keyboard, to go backwards, and very bad consequences will flow if you don't see that distinction. Okay? Long question, but that's what I got out of their method of operation argument. And I wanted you to say what you want about that.

1127,18-956,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2821.575,2854.845," Mr. Rosenkranz, can I ask you about the the standard of review question on fair use? The jury returned a verdict on fair use, and Oracle moved for judgment as a matter of law. Why wasn't the Federal Circuit required to apply the Rule 50 standard and ask whether the evidence presented at trial viewed in the light most favorable to Google would have been sufficient as a matter of law to support the jury's fair use verdict?
",-1.5316970348358154
1128,18-956,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3012.98,3145.74," Counsel, at the in your beginning statement, you had the sky falling if we ruled in favor of Google. The problem with that argument for me is that it seems that since 1992, and Justice Kagan mentioned the case, the Second Circuit case, a Ninth Circuit case, an Eleventh Circuit case, a First Circuit case, that a basic principle has developed in the case law, up until the Federal Circuit's decision. I know there was a Third Circuit decision earlier on in the 1980s. But the other circuits moved away from that. They and the entire computer world have not tried to analogize computer codes to other methods of expression because it's sui generis. They've looked at its functions, and they've said the API, the Application Programming Interface, of which the declaring code is a part, is not copyrightable. Implementing codes are. And on that understanding, industries have built up around applications that know they can they can copy only what's necessary to run on the application, but they have to change everything else. That's what Google did here. That's why it took less than 1 percent of the Java code. So I guess that's the way the world has run in every other system, whether it's Apple's desktop or Amazon's web services, everybody knows that APIs are not declaring codes are not copyrightable. Implementing codes are. So please explain to me why we should now upend what the industry has viewed as the copyrightable elements and has declared that some are methods of operation and some are expressions. Why should we change that understanding?
",0.41677647829055786
1129,18-956,Elena_Kagan_,3207.285,3249.55," Mr. Rosenkranz, as as I understand it, there are two features of your declaring code that you think merit copyright. And I want to make sure I'm I'm I'm right on this first. The the first feature, and this is pretty basic, is that we need some way of connecting a programmer's inputs, whatever they happen to be, some way of connecting those inputs to implementing code. And then the second feature is that there needs to be a way to organize those inputs, those calls, into various classes and packages. So one is like the trigger and one is the method of organization. Is that right? Is that the thing that you're saying merits copyright?
",-0.48383525013923645
1130,18-956,Elena_Kagan_,3285.71,3333.72," Okay. So let's start with that, the taxonomy, the structure, the organization, and we can, if we have time, get back to the other. I'll give you an example that's similar to one that the Chief Justice used, but I think you won't be you won't be able to answer in quite the same way. Suppose I own a grocery store and I come up with a really terrific way of organizing all my fresh produce, all my fruits and vegetables, into these categories and sub-categories, very intuitive for the shopper. And this is not the standard way. So it's different from the Chief Justice's hypothetical in that way. It's novel. And it's great. And a rival grocery store, all rival grocery stores want to copy it. Do I have a copyright claim?
",0.5020555853843689
1131,18-956,Elena_Kagan_,3355.4,3387.03," So why is it worlds different? I mean, it seems to me that there are all kinds of methods of organization in the world. You know, whether it's the QWERTY keyboard or whether it's the periodic table or whether the system of kingdoms and classes and phyla and so forth that animals are organized into. I mean, there are a thousand ways of organizing things, which the first person who developed them, you're saying, could have a copyright and then prevent anybody else from using them.

1132,18-956,Neil_Gorsuch_,3436.565,3482.30000005," Good morning, counsel. Your your colleagues on the other side suggest that the Federal Circuit did not give sufficient deference to the jury's finding of fair use. And I'd like to follow up on that and some of Justice Alito's questions. Often, you know, fact-specific questions like fair use that are multifactor balancing kind of inquiries are are reviewed for substantial evidence in the record, and that is not what the Federal Circuit here did, particularly when when the questions are kind of novel and yet and legal rules have yet to crystalize and form around them. Why why why should the Federal Circuit not have used that traditional standard of review?

Let's suppose I I agree with you I think you've said elsewhere that it properly reviewed it de novo. Why why should why shouldn't we remand the case for consideration of it under under a more deferential standard of review normally applied to jury findings and general verdicts?

First, any more you want to say about Justice Breyer's QWERTY keyboard question? And, second, Justice Sotomayor's question about settled expectations and and I would add the 83 computer scientists' concern about threatening significant disruption.

1136,18-956,Stephen_G_Breyer_,4121.535,4200.24," I'm curious as to why the government thinks the balance of harms lies the way you do. I do think of the QWERTY keyboard. The QWERTY, the keyboard, calls up the metal rods that make an impression on a piece of paper and then that's how you write words. This system calls up a system of dividing the world into a variety of tasks, which then will be done. Now, nothing in copyright is meant to give the owner of the QWERTY, whoever thought of that beginning, QWERTY, a copy a monopoly of typewriting. And nothing here, they say, if, in fact, you give them a monopoly of this, the millions of people who have learned this, as Justice Sotomayor says, will have to spend vast amounts of money when we get all kinds of new methods for using computers turning on heaters, stoves, et cetera, and a million others. And teaching them is unbelievable. It will give the owner of the declaration monopoly power over all those uses. Now, that, I think, is roughly what they're arguing. Why does the government reject that?
",0.9396330714225769
1137,18-956,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4261.89,4284.08," Well, my question for the government is essentially the one the Chief Justice asked them. There has been some elaboration on it. And obviously there is this argument that the sky is going to fall if we do not rule for Google, so unless you have do you have anything you want to add on that, on that point?
",-1.1315306425094604
1138,18-956,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4339.87,4380.485," Counsel, could you tell me why you think that Google's work was not transformative? It moved Java's platform from a PC, essentially, to mobile phones. Why wasn't that a transformative step? I mean, the the answer is that all that all fair use involves copying. So to do fair use you have to copy something and create something new from it. So why wasn't that a giant step of fair use?
",-0.22068876028060913
1139,18-956,Elena_Kagan_,4493.955,4531.535," Mr. Stewart, suppose that I come up with a new and very useful keyboard, you know, not QWERTY, but something better than QWERTY. And it's so useful that everybody starts using it. Now let's assume, for the purposes of my question, that this is copyrightable, which it might be or it might not be. But let's assume it is and and go to the fair use question. When when a a a a cell phone, a smartphone manufacturer takes that layout, takes that keyboard, and uses it for its next phone, is that fair use and why or why not?
",-0.4666510820388794
1140,18-956,Elena_Kagan_,4563.8,4581.085," So why why is it any any different here; in other words, that Google took Java's interface so the programmers wouldn't have to learn a whole new system for coding, just as the cell the cell phone manufacturer took my keyboard so that people could rely on something familiar?
",-0.5413592457771301
1141,18-956,Neil_Gorsuch_,4636.275,4675.535," Mr. Stewart, the government concedes that this work is copyrightable but then says the fair use analysis has to to permit the the copying here. And I wonder whether it it it gives with one hand and takes away with another. The the fair use analysis for incommensurable factors that need to be weighed, why could no reasonable jury have concluded that it was fair use here? Aren't you essentially saying that, yes, code, is copyrightable, but, really, it it it's always subject to fair use?

1142,18-956,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4779.555,4808.68," Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Stewart. One question on merger doctrine and one question on method of operation. First, Google says in its reply brief that the dispositive undisputed fact in this case is that the declarations could not be written in any other way and still properly respond to the calls used by Java programmers. Are they wrong in saying that?
",-0.3897494971752167
1143,18-956,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,5059.84,5099.995," I wonder if you wanted to take a bit more time to respond further to my question about why your merger argument doesn't make Sun and Oracle a a victim of its of its own success. The the Mr. Rosenkranz mentioned that several tech companies did, in fact, find a way to develop their programs without relying on the Java coding. So why shouldn't we impose that that same obligation on Oracle?
",-0.5866014957427979
1144,18-956,Stephen_G_Breyer_,5152.67500005,5183.03," I I have heard from the other side, yes, that may be true, but this result is simply calling up a set of programs that were written by Java. And maybe at the beginning you could have done this in different ways, with different divisions of tasks in a world with different call-up numbers. And there weren't people trained at that time. And copyright, you just heard quoted, runs from the beginning. What do you do about that?
",-0.41898778080940247
1145,18-956,Elena_Kagan_,5333.635,5365.45," I I'm wondering, Mr. Goldstein, whether the first part of the answer that you gave to Justice Sotomayor, whether that suggests that transformative use isn't the right question here, although it is in other contexts. I mean, as as I understand it, you're using this for the exact same purpose. It's just that the purpose, to make sure that users are dealing with a familiar interface, is one that should favor fair use. So is that right? Is the transformative use question really a mismatch in this context?
",-0.2533544898033142
1146,18-956,Neil_Gorsuch_,5413.445,5436.165," Briefly, just to follow up on on that, Justice Sotomayor's question. Mr. Stewart argued that if if we were to uphold the jury verdict or send it back on fair use, that we would be negatively impacting summary judgment practice and that most district courts take these questions up as a matter of law in summary judgment.
",-0.6678854823112488
1147,18-956,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,5508.87,5527.41," Thank you. Mr. Stewart responded to my question quoting page 7 of your reply brief about the merger doctrine. And I wanted to see if you had anything further you wanted to add on the merger doctrine to help us understand that.

1148,20-512,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,288.505,323.025," I I think maybe, Mr. Waxman, the one limitation that is the most troublesome is or or lack of limitation, I guess, that schools can pay up to $50,000 for a $10 million insurance policy to protect student-athletes for future earnings. Now that sounds very much like pay for play. You know, you're you're paying the insurance premium so that they will play at college and not in the pros. Doesn't that undermine the amateur status theory you have?
",0.5526885390281677
1149,20-512,Clarence_Thomas_,372.34,410.19," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Waxman, just a little bit a matter of curiosity to me. You put a lot of weight on focus on amateurism. Is there a similar and and you look at the limitations of the benefits or pay to players. But is there a similar focus on the compensation to coaches to maintain that distinction between amateur coaches, coaches in the amateur ranks, as opposed to coaches in the pro ranks?
",-0.9251500964164734
1150,20-512,Clarence_Thomas_,471.935,504.995," Well, it just strikes me as odd that the coaches' salaries have ballooned and they're in the amateur ranks, as are the players. But be that as it may, in Board of Regents, at least as I read it, the where the NCAA also defended its or the amateurism interest, we did we conduct a deferential quick look review?
",-0.01277326513081789
1151,20-512,Stephen_G_Breyer_,611.085,653.78," I have two questions. The first one is, what is it precisely that you are complaining about in this Court? From much of what has been argued, I thought it was the injunction part on page it's pages 119a, 47a, and 208a. And and the injunction and the court of appeals seem to say, NCAA, you cannot limit giving them musical instruments, computers, et cetera, and then they add the cost of post-eligibility internships, vocational schools does that mean, like, law school and there are a few couple other things.
",-0.45212045311927795
1152,20-512,Stephen_G_Breyer_,654.41,680.51," Is it that you just think these you know what the latter things are. They're they're in your mind, okay. That could be hundreds of thousands of dollars. I mean, law school is expensive. I don't know if it's a vocational school, but they could they they could be. They could be very, very expensive. So that limit may come close to saying, NCAA, you can let these schools get away with murder in terms of what they give the athletes and you have to. Or --
",0.9275039434432983
1153,20-512,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,882.99,958.785," Mr. Waxman, let me put on the table some of what is said by those who challenge your idea of amateurism. The briefs that are supported that are submitted in support of the Respondents paint a pretty stark picture, and they argue that colleges with powerhouse football and basketball programs are really exploiting the students that they recruit. They have programs that bring in billions of dollars. As Justice Thomas mentioned, the this money funds enormous salaries for coaches and others in huge athletic departments. But the athletes themselves have a pretty hard life. They face training requirements that leave little time or energy for study, constant pressure to put sports above study, pressure to drop out of hard majors and hard classes, really shockingly low graduation rates. Only a tiny percentage ever go on to make any money in professional sports. So the argument is they are recruited, they're used up, and then they're cast aside without even a college degree. So they say, how can this be defended in the name of amateurism?
",1.3038376569747925
1154,20-512,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,1077.39,1112.8," Yeah, the athletes on the crew and and fencing, but, for the the powerhouse basketball and football programs, it's different. Let me let me squeeze in one more question, which seems goes to the heart of what I'm wrestling with. You say that what's distinctive about your product is that your players are not paid. And that was true a hundred years ago. But, in fact, they are paid. They get lower admission standards. They get tuition, room and board, and other things. That's a form of pay. So the distinction is not whether they're going to be paid. It's the form in which they're going to be paid and how much they're going to be paid, isn't that right?
",0.6659647822380066
1155,20-512,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1154.615,1187.77000005," I thought, Mr. Waxman, that the district court's injunction only prohibits the NCAA from limiting education-related expenses. It does not prohibit the conference from doing so. So, if your priority is maintaining amateurism in college athletics and you and your members think that increasing education-related benefits will undermine the spirit of amateurism, why don't the conferences impose those limits?
",0.12072313576936722
1156,20-512,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1245.7,1269.755," all of your parade of horribles, the government says, are taken care of by that limitation. If you think that internships should be related in some way to the educational experience, you could pass rules to that effect. So why doesn't that take care of your parade of horribles?
",0.03778799995779991
1157,20-512,Elena_Kagan_,1373.925,1423.02," Mr. Waxman, the way you talk about amateurism, it it sounds awfully high-minded. But there's another way to think about what's going on here, and that's that schools that are naturally competitors as to athletes have all gotten together in an organization, an organization that has undisputed market power, and they use that power to fix athletic salaries at extremely low levels, far lower than what the market would set if it were allowed to operate. So why shouldn't we think of it in just that kind of way, that these are competitors, all getting together with total market power, fixing prices?
",1.1344003677368164
1158,20-512,Elena_Kagan_,1461.95,1497.52," Well, you can only ride on the history, I think, Mr. Waxman, for so long. I mean, a great deal has changed since a hundred years ago in the way that student-athletes are treated. And, you know, I'll take you back to Justice Alito's question and the kind of payments that they're given. You know, a great deal has changed even since Board of Regents, let alone a hundred years ago. So I guess it doesn't move me all that much that there's a history to this if what is going on now is that competitors as to labor are combining to fix prices.
",0.9317961931228638
1159,20-512,Elena_Kagan_,1514.17,1534.255," that's true about some things. I mean, you know, sports leagues have to get together to figure out the rules of the game, how many people are going to be on on the court at any one time. So, of course, there are things that there needs to be cooperation for. But why does there there why does there need to be cooperation on the cost of labor?
",-0.16199609637260437
1160,20-512,Elena_Kagan_,1545.24,1592.36," if that were true, Mr. Waxman, you would have an argument. But, as I understand what the trial court did here, it basically took a lot of evidence as to that question, as to whether the lack of pay to play was anything that consumers wanted, and what it found was that consumers didn't really care about that. The the the other side's experts found on the basis of survey evidence and so forth that payments of $10,000 or more would not affect demand. Your expert failed to show anything to the contrary. Essentially, you're saying that the differentiating feature is the lack of pay to play. But the evidence in this trial suggested exactly the opposite.
",0.18716147541999817
1161,20-512,Neil_Gorsuch_,1639.45,1733.655," Mr. Waxman, it seems to me you you start in a place that I I can readily sign up to, which is that joint ventures often need to have agreements that would otherwise look anticompetitive, whether they're territorial allocations or price agreements, in order to create a product that wouldn't otherwise exist. And we usually give that a pretty quick look, maybe even a twinkling of the eye. So that all that all makes sense to me, and we certainly don't want to go back to the bad old days of reviewing any joint venture agreement that restricts competition through per se analysis or or something that looks like a strict scrutiny analysis, which I understand you condemn the the Ninth Circuit for doing. So I understand all of that. I think the trick comes for me at least sort of where Justice Kagan was alluding to, which is, here, the agreement that's really at the center of the case is an agreement among competitors to fix price with the labor market, where you have monopsony control, and that's unusual. The normal joint venture is is in a competitive market. But, here, the NCAA has monopsony control over labor price. There aren't other leagues in which might compete with the NCAA that might allow payments, and you could test consumer demand that way. So why why isn't the the monopsony control over the labor market at least an appropriate basis for a more more searching rule of reason analysis?

1162,20-512,Neil_Gorsuch_,1819.21,1841.745," No, no, no, no, no, no apologies. Let's just just drill down a little bit further. I I guess what I'm trying to ask you, and maybe I did so inartfully, is whether the fact that the NCAA has monopsony control over the labor market, it is a sole purchaser of the labor does that make a difference in our rule what would otherwise be a forgiving rule of reason analysis to a joint venture?

1163,20-512,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1891.68,2009.72," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Waxman. I want to pick up from Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch and identify some issues of concern to me as I look at this. I start from the idea that the antitrust laws should not be a cover for exploitation of the student-athletes, so that is a concern, a overarching concern here. I see your rhetoric and tradition and history argument as being very similar to the arguments that were made for exempting baseball from the antitrust laws, Flood v. Kuhn, Federal Federal Baseball, and that that exemption has not been replicated in other sports in other cases. And then, in Regents, as Justice Kagan said, that really was from a different era, it it was dicta, not sure it was fully considered dicta, and, in any event, from a different era. So then we get to regular antitrust law, rule of reason, and I just want to drill down on your asserted procompetitive justification and how you say the product is differentiated. It does seem, as Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch suggested, Justice Alito, that schools are conspiring with competitors, agreeing with competitors, I'll say that, to pay no salaries to the workers who are making the schools billions of dollars on the theory that consumers want the schools to pay their workers nothing. And that just seems entirely circular and even somewhat disturbing. And then, as Justice Kagan says, it's not even factually supported in the record in this case. It seems to blend back to the tradition argument, and all things circle back to this idea, well, it should just just don't worry about it, college athletics is different, just like baseball. So those are the concerns I have initially. Interested in your response.

1164,20-512,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2115.84,2153.67," But, if the consumers don't care I mean, you said earlier this would allow the players to receive $6,000 a year, as if that were some exorbitant amount when the TV contracts are in the billions. Six thousand a year is not not a lot given the time and the injuries and the inability to go to class or to major in the thing they want to or to do summer jobs. I mean, you're talking about $6,000 as if it's some exorbitant amount.

1165,20-512,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2206.82,2246.295," When you answered him, you said it's not pay because the NCAA has defined ""pay"" as the reasonable and necessary expenses to obtain education. But I'm wondering, why does the NCAA get to define what pay is? And I think, you know, this is based on experience, but there are certainly plenty of parents and students I mean, some people want to play in college for the love of the game. Some people think they'll be able to go pro. A lot of people do it because they want to be able to afford college educations or or, you know, get the in-kind benefit equal to, you know, say, 30- or 40,000 dollars worth of of tuition. So why do you get to define what pay is?

1166,20-512,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2301.62,2314.675," And is that how you would define an amateur, as someone who is unpaid? Because I think that gets back to the point of, is it a procompetitive or a legitimate procompetitive justification to say that consumers love watching unpaid unpaid people play sports?

1167,20-512,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2374.52,2397.805," I want to shift gears, Mr. Waxman, and ask you about the effects that ruling against you might have. So, you know, you told Justice Thomas that the ballooning of coaches' salaries is attributable to the the ruling in the Tenth Circuit that they can't be capped under the antitrust laws. So, if we rule against you, what's the impact of the decision on Title IX and women's sports?
",-1.0246148109436035
1168,20-512,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2684.22,2738.845," the thing that concerns me about your approach that was adopted by the court below, the NCAA has a number of limitations that are designed to ensure that its product is amateur athletic competition. And you look at and the district court looks at one rule, and let's say it's a limit of $2,000 for something, and you say we can make that less restrictive. Let's make it $2,500, and that's fine, and that doesn't alter the public perception of what's going on. But then you go on to another rule and fiddle with that in the same way and another one and another one, and and it's like a game of Jenga. You've got this nice solid block that protects the sort of product the schools want to provide, and you pull out one log and then another and everything's fine, then another and another and all of a sudden the whole thing's come comes crashing down. What what's your answer to that way of looking at it?

Briefly, Mr. Kessler, the just following up on what you just said, what if you have a consumer survey that suggests tomorrow that the consumers think it's fine for amateur athletes to make $20,000 a year? Would we be back in court with litigation suggest about that rather as opposed to the $6,000 a year?
",-1.5450233221054077
1170,20-512,Clarence_Thomas_,2887.03,2930.03," You know, that I'm sorry to cut you off, Mr. Kessler, but that that sounds fine for the upper-level schools, whether it's, you know you know, Alabama, Ohio State, and Nebraska, but it doesn't for the schools that have more modest circumstances, it would seem that they would begin to the the bigger schools would begin to cherry-pick with the transfer portal the athletes from the lower schools simply because they're able to afford this income that you're talking about. So have you considered that as a problem in an environment where you're trying to remain maintain competitiveness and amateur status?
",0.3373388350009918
1171,20-512,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2986.375,3097.625," I think, if we really have a case here, it's a tough case for me, and the reason it's so tough is for me is because this is not an ordinary product. This is an effort to bring into the world something that's brought joy and all kinds of things to to millions and millions of people, and it's only partly economic. Okay? So I worry a lot about judges getting into the business of deciding how amateur sports should be run. And I can think of ways around that. First, you could just say it's a different kind of product. This is what you would lose on this. Second, you could say that consumer demand is not at all the only criteria. You could have a purple widget joint venture and you say nobody can make red widgets and, I'm sorry, they can't, even if consumers would just as much like red widgets, because it's a purple widget joint venture. Or you could say this is a rule of reason, take into account other things. Take into account administrative problems in working out these rules for the NCAA and the fact that that nobody can work with 40,000 professors in schools and everybody thinking something different. You're going to obviously end up with something of a mess. And it's a tough problem for them. Now, having thought of four or five different ways by means of which you lose, I also think I'm very worried about my ways, because how do I do it? If I say these things, I might be also affecting the real economic joint venture, like for technology companies. Now I'm telling you my real thoughts, and I'd like to hear your and also Mr. Wackman Waxman's response.

1172,20-512,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3261.975,3301.74," Do you think that what the district court allowed here and the Ninth Circuit sustained as the outer limit could would the antitrust laws allow applicants, student recruited athletes to bargain for, let's say, a guarantee not to lose a scholarship if they're injured, a guarantee of tuition, room and board for a certain number of years after eligibility so that they would be able to graduate, the provision of tuition, room and board for graduate studies?

1173,20-512,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3381.2,3404.615," All right. Number two, generally speaking, antitrust courts do not get into the business of price administration. Why are the the limits of the injunction below of academic achievement awards at a fixed price of $5980 not a de facto price setting?

1174,20-512,Elena_Kagan_,3486.71,3511.585," Mr. Kessler, I recognize that you didn't cross-petition, but I can't believe that you think that this $5980 award was the limit of where the district court could have gone. So I just thought, you know, on this record here's the question: On this record, how high could the district court have gone before compromising consumer demand for college sports?
",0.2601620852947235
1175,20-512,Elena_Kagan_,3584.3,3611.805," I mean, your answers here raise two questions, Mr. Kessler, and the first is is what you've heard before from some of my colleagues, a kind of floodgates argument, like what's next? It's just going to go up and up and up, and pretty soon it will just be a regular labor market. And the second is, isn't there some kind some kind of arbitrariness about this $5980 award that we should react badly to?

1176,20-512,Neil_Gorsuch_,3637.525,3687.11," Mr. Kessler, I'd just like to talk about antitrust law generally for a moment and pick up on where I left off with your opponent. Normally, in joint venture law, this Court has come to recognize that we shouldn't be flyspecking individual aspects of covenants not to compete amongst joint venture participants because they're creating a new product that wouldn't otherwise be available in a market and that the rules of reason should be pretty light and that plaintiff bears a heavy burden to show that a covenant not to compete violates the Sherman Act. This case, the the Ninth Circuit, the district court, applied a pretty searching inquiry on covenants, each an individual aspect of them. What, in your view, as a matter of law forget about the facts for a moment makes that kind of searching inquiry appropriate?
",-0.2151278257369995
1177,20-512,Neil_Gorsuch_,3721.9,3741.84," Let me let me just stop you there. Does it have something to do with the fact that this product market, there's only one and that the NCAA has monopoly control over the labor market? We call it monopsony control. You've referred to it a few times. What what role does that play or influence should it have in how we view the rule of reason's application in this circumstance?
",-0.4305208921432495
1178,20-512,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3837.055,3874.88," As Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan raised, I think we need to think about what the next case would look like if we rule in your favor in this case. As Justice Sotomayor correctly pointed out, you're asking for a narrow ruling here, but the rationale behind that ruling could generate follow-on litigation. What in your view is the endgame of this litigation if you not this particular litigation but of future litigation. Is the endgame collective bargaining? Is the endgame legislation? I think this picks up on Justice Breyer's questions as well.
",-0.4329609274864197
1179,20-512,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3938.895,3997.425," Mr. Kessler, the tenor to me when I read it of both the district court and Ninth Circuit opinions is that they were trying not to do too much. And and this, I think, goes back to Justice Breyer's description of, you know, this is a delicate area. On the one hand, there's concern about blowing up the NCAA and something that people have, as Justice Breyer Justice Breyer put it, gotten so much joy out of but then, you know, messing up general antitrust law. So it seemed to me that the lower court opinions were kind of saying, like, the educational expenses weren't that big of a deal. The cash, you know, it wasn't that high an amount. You yourself described the injunction as narrow and an effort by the court to give the NCAA as much leeway as possible, is how you put it in your brief. So, given all of that, how are how is the injunction a substantially less restrictive alternative, or do you disagree that it had to be substantially less restrictive and just had to be less restrictive?

The you frequently emphasize that the restrictions imposed by the court below were modest ones, but I don't think the principle was. And when you go through, as I was mentioning to your your friend, there will be a wide number of rules that are subject to challenge, if not in this litigation, in subsequent cases. And the effect it seems to me is to substitute the Court's view for the business judgment of the people responsible for a joint venture that we have upheld as procompetitive. And I just don't know if the judge is the best person to assess the competitive effect of the rules or the people managing the joint venture. Do you have any thoughts about that?

General, the I'm still a bit perplexed as to how the NCAA would be able to preserve what it thinks is an important distinction between student-athletes and professional athletes without constantly being involved in litigation.

",0.1490066647529602
1182,20-512,Clarence_Thomas_,4430.65,4459.955," Well, you know, that's as we've seen, the world has changed in sports, and it could change dramatically again, and the next survey or at least the impression that the public has about amateur athletics could suggest that, well, 10- or 20,000 dollars of cash is fine, and still preserve the amateur status.

One, a joint venture sometimes can have a noneconomic, sometimes, as well as an economic objective. Two, the word ""reason"" means reason. And when you consider whether a rule is unreasonable because there is a less restrictive alternative, take into account that noneconomic reason, the impossibility of measuring everything against consumer demand or the undesirability where there is that noneconomic reason, the difficulty of measuring each mini rule against something called consumer demand. And, four, the difficulty of administering a system that has thousands of members. Okay? Now suppose I were to write that. What would be your instant reaction of why that's totally wrong?

So suppose a group said we want to take advantage of this unmet demand. We're going to organize a new professional league, but we are going to cap the salaries of all of our players at 1955 levels, corrected for inflation. Would that get a quick look?

Meaning we're being told by Mr. Waxman that all of these education-related payments can become extravagant and, as a result, be viewed by the public as pay for play. Any fix would come after the fact, after the game has been after amateurism has been destroyed in college sports. How do we ensure that doesn't happen?

1186,20-512,Elena_Kagan_,4909.365,4941.78," General, would I be wrong to think that this $5980 was essentially taken out of thin air, that it's arbitrary? I mean, you mentioned that it was designed to match these athletic awards. But, as far as I know, there's no evidence that any single player has ever received that amount in athletic awards. Wasn't the court just looking for any old number to, you know, hang its hat on, but the the one it came up with was essentially arbitrary?
",0.7773053050041199
1187,20-512,Neil_Gorsuch_,5016.57,5083.77000005," General, see see if you disagree with any of this and, if so, please tell me why, that normally this Court has come to recognize that ancillary restraints in joint ventures, including price restraints, territorial restraints, are procompetitive and deserve a very light look from courts because a joint venture creates a new product that wouldn't otherwise exist and that is procompetitive. We recognize, though, that that's assuming a competitive market. And what differentiates this case is that the NCAA is the market for student-athlete labor. It has monopsony control. And so that that unique feature is what justifies the more searching inquiry that took place in this case and that it might be a very different case if there were multiple leagues or, here, conferences that had restrictions on price that are paid to student-athletes and that some some conferences without market power, for example, might be able to do that, fully compliant with the antitrust laws. It's just that you can't set one rule for the whole market.

The label of education-related benefits I think Mr. Waxman would say is being stretched here and that this is really going to turn into very quickly just an automatic payment to student-athletes, and, thus, it's a mistake, I think he would say, to call it education-related. What's your response to that?

So it balanced the competition in the labor market against the market for college sports. And I understand that that's the way the case came to us because that's the framework the lower courts used and the one on which the parties agreed. But some of the amici have criticized it. So I'm wondering if you think it is, you know, performing any kind of distorting effect that would influence the way we think about this case in a bad way?

The one thing you know is that the person inside is trying to get away from you, and, you know, if you go right up to the door and knock, there's no reason to you you shouldn't be concerned that he might swing the door open and have a have have a gun. And the alternative you suggest about, well, just, you know, you you you can go get a warrant, but, you know, it's easier to get a warrant now than it was maybe 20 years ago, but you still don't have any idea how long that's going to take, and during that time, you know, the the person in the house can also destroy evidence or, again, arm arm himself, call confederates to to come.

1195,20-18,Clarence_Thomas_,417.75,439.045," One of the things and this is just an aside it just seems a little odd that we would look to common law to determine whether or not a warrantless entry is permitted, and yet the remedy is the exclusionary rule, which has no basis in common law. How do you reconcile those two?

But our case, Santana, and certainly the lowers courts have said we need an absolute rule here. It's just not worth it. The person who's being chased can just stop. He's supposed to. And there are dangers all over the place. Sometimes not. Sometimes there's a good reason. But it's a bright-line rule that says hot pursuit is automatically exigent circumstances. So what do we do about all those cases? And you can find some counter-examples but not too many.

1197,20-18,Stephen_G_Breyer_,540.47,553.365," Let me cut you off there for a second, because the problem with trying to separate misdemeanor and and felony is that different states have different rules and different crimes that count as misdemeanors and some are pretty serious.

1198,20-18,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,647.21,752.30000005," Mr. Fisher, let me try out this argument which supports your position, and the argument very simply is that hot pursuit has to be hot and it has to be a pursuit. It has to it has to involve a chase. The person, the arrestee, must actually be trying to flee and avoid arrest, and that makes it it there are justifications for such a doctrine because, when an arrestee is chased and flees into his house, there are strong reasons across the board for not waiting for a warrant. There's a heightened risk that this person is going to sneak away before the house can be surrounded. One of the briefs says it takes six to eight officers to surround the house waiting for a warrant. There's a heightened risk that evidence is going to be destroyed, a heightened risk that the person is going to barricade himself in the house, get a gun, and resist the execution of a warrant. Here, the the video shows there was no chase and Mr. Lange really didn't flee, and all that the court below held was that a reasonable person in his position would have known that the officer was trying to stop him. That after viewing the video, even that seems to me dubious. And if you take into account Mr. Lange's blood alcohol content, it's even more questionable. But, if we hold that hot pursuit requires a hot pursuit, won't we go a long way toward preventing warrantless arrests for minor infractions and therefore deal with the serious problems that you raise in your brief?
",0.7264750599861145
1199,20-18,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,807.47,830.665," Well, it's not it's not perfect. But the alternative is either to require impossible line-drawing between minor offenses and major offenses or completely overhaul what has been understood as the Hot Pursuit Doctrine. So there would have to be exigent circumstances even where the offense is a felony and a very serious felony.
",0.649978518486023
1200,20-18,Sonia_Sotomayor_,860.16,903.52," Mr. Fisher, I'm trying to figure out, going back to what Justice Alito was saying, what circumstance where there is a genuine hot pursuit do you think would not justify a police officer, just on the basis of the pursuit, believing that the person was trying to hide something, trying to perhaps destroy evidence, whatever the cause, why wouldn't that justify entry wouldn't the nature of the pursuit itself --

1201,20-18,Elena_Kagan_,1040.04,1077.12," Mr. Fisher, unlike California, you take the position there's no categorical rule even as to fleeing felons. And I'm I'm wondering if you would try to defend that for me because I I look at our case law and see quite a number of cases which have one after another after another, Justice, you know, said that there is such a rule as to fleeing felons. So how do you deal with quite a lot of you know, some of it dicta, but but really quite a lot of statements to that effect?

Would ruling in your favor create kind of an absurd incentive for states to actually make failure to heed a a police officer's lights, rather than a misdemeanor, turn it into a felony? Do you worry about that?
",-0.19816242158412933
1204,20-18,Neil_Gorsuch_,1275.57,1294.735," In terms of hot pursuit and the discussion we've had so far this morning, if we if we try to place limits on what makes a pursuit hot instead of limits on the seriousness of the suspected crime, which I understood to be the question presented, would those rules about hot pursuit be anything more than dicta in this case?
",-1.2312129735946655
1205,20-18,Neil_Gorsuch_,1358.955,1384.815," I understand. I just want to with my little time left I'm sorry, Mr. Fisher, for interrupting you, but I do have another question. That is, you ask us to take everything on a case-by-case approach. Your amicus, the Constitutional Accountability Center, offers more seeks to offer more guidance through reference to the common law and identifying rules that we can draw out of that. What's your response to that approach?

1206,20-18,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1436.945,1519.06500005," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Fisher. I want to follow up on questions from the Chief Justice and Justice Breyer about how exigent circumstances would work in this situation because it seems to me that there's a chance that Exigent Circumstances Doctrine would essentially cover the waterfront of all the circumstances you would have when you have a hot pursuit to the house. So, on page 14 of your brief, you refer summarize existing doctrine with respect to destruction of evidence, the risk of persons who are threatened with serious injury, to protect the officers or the public, and then you also say and this is the one I really want to explore to prevent a suspect's escape. And wouldn't the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine in all those things apply almost inevitably in a hot pursuit case, particularly preventing a suspect's escape, because the suspect has already escaped, in essence, from or fled from the officer, and so, to use your phrase, there is reason to believe I think that was your phrase to the Chief Justice there's reason to believe that the suspect will escape from the house because they've already fled?

1207,20-18,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1639.02,1659.27," Good morning, Mr. Fisher. I want to ask you about the analytical distinction between escaping arrest and evading arrest. So do you concede that the exception would apply and the policeman could break down the door, so to speak, enter the home without a warrant, if the defendant had escaped arrest?
",-1.1897153854370117
1208,20-18,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1691.38,1731.19," Well, I I understand that, but, I mean, custody here you know, let's imagine you have somebody who has committed something we would all agree would be a misdemeanor, something minor like but but not in a car. Let's say it's on foot. Let's say it's some minor vandalism in a park. And the police approach, have the show of authority, and stop the person they've submitted to authority. You know, there you have an arrest. And then the person turns on his heels and runs. It's hard to see where there's a meaningful analytical distinction between someone who's been arrested, who's been seized in that sense, and then runs and someone who just runs from the beginning after the police, you know, shows authority and says stop. What's the analytical distinction?
",0.44863957166671753
1209,20-18,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1795.27,1825.88," why wouldn't it apply? I mean, you you you said nine times out of 10 that in my hypothetical where someone just refuses to submit, turns and runs, that there won't be really a distinction between that person and the person who initially stops and then runs. So why you know, and the person may not you used the example of someone who might be disabled or young or afraid. Why doesn't the certitude you know, the room the room for doubt give the officer the ability there to say it's an exigent circumstance?

1210,20-18,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1984.19,2024.06," I I guess I would pose the question that Justice Breyer was focusing on. The line between felonies and misdemeanors is is very hard to draw. In many cases, it's counterintuitive, and it certainly varies from state to state. You know, if it's drunk driving, it can be a felony if it's your third offense. I mean, how does an officer know whether it's the first offense or the third? It can depend on the value of stolen goods. How does the officer know that? It seems to me and and it's a it's a distinction that we rejected in another context pertinent here, the Atwater case. What about all those uncertainties?

1211,20-18,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2053.92,2072.83," What do you what do you do with respect to curtilage? You know, a man's home is his castle, but we've also extended special protection to curtilage. Do do you your rules apply in that case? You know, can they why isn't the person home free when he's on the porch, he doesn't have to go through the door at all?
",-0.7487710118293762
1212,20-18,Clarence_Thomas_,2200.14,2218.57," Well, for I think, as the Chief Justice mentioned and Justice Breyer, that's a line that we've had quite a bit of difficulty drawing, but beyond that, what prevents a state from simply enacting a law that says evading arrest or fleeing from a police officer is a felony?
",-0.64255291223526
1213,20-18,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2239.975,2305.46499995," Thank you. Look, to be not to put to be specific, as far as I know, a misdemeanor in Massachusetts is defined as a crime for which the sentence in jail is up to two-and-a-half years and the jail term must be served, however, not in the state prison but in a local county jail. All right? So we include as misdemeanors assault and battery, carrying a loaded firearm under the influence of drugs, reckless driving where a death results. I mean, they're pretty serious. So, under your rule, if you're after somebody who's just beaten up five people, assault and battery, or he has just really been driving recklessly and killed his wife, you're saying no hot pursuit, right? But, in California, misdemeanor's very different, minor. What do we do?
",0.7042099237442017
1214,20-18,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2329.67,2376.66," So, in Massachusetts, if, in fact, he's beaten up into a bloody pulp four people, you cannot just automatically hotly pursue him into the house, but, in California, you can because it's a felony, or what? I mean, they'll be all over the place. We'll have I mean, that's what I don't see how to draw this line, misdemeanor/felony. And you don't in California. What you, in fact, have been saying is a misdemeanor the hot pursuit rule also allows pursuit into the home if it's jailable, which, by the way, picks up auctioning off a rabbit as a prize, which carries a jail term.
",1.2713748216629028
1215,20-18,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2440.74,2456.955," Well, what if the person could get two consecutive 11-month sentences? If he could get one sentence of a year and a day, that would fall within on one side of the line, but two consecutive 11-month sentences would not.
",-0.589970052242279
1216,20-18,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2477.65,2505.725," Well, let me ask you this question: Under the California constitution, does the Attorney General have the authority to tell the district attorneys of the states that it of the state that it will not that they are not to defend any warrantless arrests of persons in the home where the offense is a minor offense as defined by some definition provided by the Attorney General?
",-1.3540130853652954
1217,20-18,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2534.35,2556.95," Well, if the Attorney General could do that, I really don't understand why you are here. You are here on behalf of the State of California asking us to hold that a California rule is unconstitutional, even though the Attorney General, whom you represent, may well be able to effect that change as a matter of policy.
",0.338428795337677
1218,20-18,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2585.75,2713.28," Counsel, I've been listening to the exchange with my colleagues involving the difficulty in deciding what's a felony and what's a misdemeanor. Part of the problem is that what are felonies are no longer absolutely, necessarily, and in all situations dangerous crimes. You can have white-collar crimes where there is no danger. You can have all sorts of environmental crimes, other things that don't cause that don't create exigency in the same sense that Santana was announcing the rule or that the common law came from. And so I don't know why anybody is arguing that there's a difference between felony and misdemeanors and why we're recognizing a categorical rule at all. Why isn't the better reading just that hot pursuit is a type of exigent circumstance that can but does not always justify warrantless entry, regardless of whether the underlying offense is a felony or misdemeanor? If you look at our holding in Santana, we talked about all of the circumstances that would make it likely that a drug dealer would destroy evidence once they saw the police officer on on the scene. Our next case, Stanton, was not about whether or not the issue was a felony or not. It was the issue was, was the situation such as to justify, reasonably, entry? So I guess what I'm asking is, why don't we just announce the rule that I stated, that exigency can but doesn't always, whether it's a misdemeanor or a felony, justify a warrantless entry?
",0.7104201912879944
1219,20-18,Elena_Kagan_,2757.01,2817.74," Mr. Harbourt, to continue with the difficulty of drawing lines between felonies and misdemeanors, Justice Sotomayor referred to this, but, you know, it it's true that it's the basic line suggesting the severity of the fence the offense, but it's really not the basic line as to whether an offense is violent or dangerous. I mean, sometimes it is, but a lot of times it's not. And that the violence and dangerous aspect of of the conduct seems the more relevant one for purposes of deciding when an intrusion into the home is proper. So just to give you an example, most domestic violence laws continue to be misdemeanors, and then, on the other hand, as Justice Sotomayor said, most white-collar fraud offenses are felonies. That that doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense with respect to when you would allow intrusions into the home and when not.
",0.618196964263916
1220,20-18,Neil_Gorsuch_,2871.42,2933.225," Good morning, counsel. I think my colleagues have kind of pointed out two two difficulties with your argument. First, Justice Breyer points out that different states have different rules about what a felony is and what a misdemeanor is, and it would seem odd that the Constitution would in its meaning, would depend upon the happenstance of positive state law. And, second, we live in a world in which everything has been criminalized. And some professors have even opined that there's not an American alive who hasn't committed a felony in some under some state law. And in a world like that, why doesn't it make sense to retreat back to the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment, which I'm going to oversimplify but generally says that you get to go into a home without a warrant if the officer sees a a a violent action or something that's likely to be lead to imminent violence? That that's vastly oversimplifying, but why isn't why isn't that the right approach?
",0.8776500225067139
1221,20-18,Neil_Gorsuch_,2970.19,2994.54499995," And what unified that entire class of cases seems to be, again, some actual violence or its imminent threat. And the what what qualified as a felony at common law was were very few crimes and they were all punished by the death penalty usually, and today pretty much again anything or everything can be called a felony.
",0.2023550122976303
1222,20-18,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3062.81,3085.41," And that wouldn't necessarily always have what Justice Gorsuch was talking about with respect to violence. It could, it might not, but I think everyone's conceded in this case, you and Mr. Fisher or acknowledged I don't want to put it pejoratively but acknowledged what the law is that preventing escape is an exigent circumstance that would justify warrantless entry into the house, correct?
",0.35590222477912903
1223,20-18,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3086.795,3124.475," Okay. And then, on the common law, the amicus at page 23 and this is picking up on a question Justice Barrett asked and Justice Thomas asked to Mr. Fisher page 23 of the amicus brief says a warrantless arrest at common law could always be made whenever a person was lawfully arrested for any cause and afterwards escaped and sheltered himself in a house. Now, of course, that's after an arrest, but I think Justice Barrett's questions pointed out this is an extremely close analogue in many circumstances. What's your response to that aspect of the common law?
",-1.016233205795288
1224,20-18,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3176.5,3211.78999995," Good morning, Mr. Harbourt. So you just told Justice Kavanaugh that even if we say that the common law had a rule that was limited to felonies, that you agree that exigent circumstances would justify a a warrantless entry into the home. If, in fact, the common law rule was quite narrow and said warrantless entries into the home only when there are felonies, breaches of the peace and affrays, and escapes from arrest, why wouldn't that end the matter? Tell me explain to me what your rationale is for saying that you would then go on to exigent circumstances.
",-0.08134635537862778
1225,20-18,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3275.6,3294.015," I guess I don't really understand because, in in the misdemeanor cases that you're positing, they just kind of fall in a different category. You're saying most just fall into the same kind of, like, break in the door because there's a dispute going on inside or there's a fire or there's some danger. Why isn't it all then just exigent circumstances, as Mr. Fisher proposes?
",0.4003746807575226
1226,20-18,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3504.17,3572.30999995," Counsel, a lot of your argument is focused on uncertainties, you know, the officers don't know why the person is fleeing, they don't know what he might do in inside the house, that sort of thing. And I understand that to be the basis for your support of a categorical rule. But there are going to be some cases where there aren't there isn't really any uncertainty. You know, some that have been suggested, the you know, the group of teenagers in the empty lot drinking drinking beer, and the officer comes, up and they all all take off. Why isn't it and it may not be a case-by-case approach, but I guess close to what the Solicitor General is suggesting, which is a a presumption? I mean, do you really need to have the right of hot pursuit in the case that I've hypothesized? You know, no real basis for chasing the the 18 or the 18-year-old drinking beer with his friends into into his parents' house?
",0.6623364090919495
1227,20-18,Clarence_Thomas_,3675.26,3698.915," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, I'd like to refer back to Justice Alito's first question about looking at hot pursuit in a more rigorous way. Wouldn't your argument be a bit easier if, for example, in this case, there was actually a hot pursuit rather than this kind of meandering pursuit that we have here?
",-0.9830309748649597
1228,20-18,Clarence_Thomas_,3723.485,3750.275," Well, it you you do cite Santana, and I think we've read it that way. But do you do you have any cases that say expressly that a warrantless entry is is available even in cases of or in cases of all misdemeanors as opposed to some misdemeanors?
",-1.0733522176742554
1229,20-18,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3837.03,3915.035," Well, I mean, this is a tough case. Justice Goldberg you remind me when on a different subject many years ago spoke of a cruel trilemma. Well, here, if we take your view, then it seems like the home isn't the castle at all for the most trivial of things. I mean, many examples I like the rabbit example. I don't know why California has made it a crime to give a lot rabbit as a lottery prize or something. But, I mean, it seems ridiculous when your home isn't your castle for terribly minor things. If we take the opposite view, we lose the benefits of a bright line where hot pursuit is really serving an important purpose. And if we take the middle thing, we have to do this distinction, misdemeanors and felonies, which is tough. In your reading for this, because you did a good job of preparing, did you come across anything that sort of listed for us the reasons for hot pursuit and why it's there as a special category so you might say, look, hot pursuit where these reasons are there but not hot pursuit, has to be just the regular exigency, where the crime is minor, somehow defined? Have you come across something I could read on that?
",1.084873080253601
1230,20-18,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3938.02,3949.635," Yeah, I know those things, that's true, but what I mean, look, the rabbit case, I mean, that's ridiculous. The policeman can just get into your house when you went inside your house because you once sold a rabbit as a prize?
",1.400101900100708
1231,20-18,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4021.25,4053.01," All right. And and the question that we accepted includes the term includes the phrase, ""a state law enforcement officer's pursuit"" of the Petitioner. The court below held only that a reasonable person in Mr. Lange's position would have seen the police lights and understood that the police officer was trying to stop him. But there is no hold there is no finding and there is no holding that he was attempting to avoid arrest.
",-0.1416814923286438
1232,20-18,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4095.5,4123.065," Well, no matter whose perspective we look at this from the officer's perspective, Mr. Lange's perspective isn't the question whether he tried to get into his house for the purpose of evading arrest? And it wouldn't be a subjective inquiry; it would be an objective inquiry. Would an objective taking a look at this video, objectively, was this an attempt to evade arrest?
",-0.09184090793132782
1233,20-18,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4141.145,4160.75," Well, that wasn't something that was held by the lower court. That wasn't the standard the lower court applied. And I will tell you, looking at this video, I I see no attempt to avoid arrest. I see somebody who who may well have not have even noticed these lights and simply proceeded into his own garage.
",1.0755149126052856
1234,20-18,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4204.515,4314.715," Counsel, assuming that I find the common law unclear on the margins, but I don't find it unclear that the common law by its nature allowed for entry warrantless entries into the home only for a certain not not for offenses that were minor, that every offense it listed was or or exception that it created was for serious offenses, not minor ones. How can I how can we ignore that teaching of the common law? And I guess I go back to Justice Gorsuch's point that perhaps we should just hew to the common law more strictly and recognize exceptions only that reflect the teachings of the common law, so exigent circumstances, hot pursuit for serious offenses that themselves, like the Solicitor General suggests, suggest a basis for entry or a need for entry. Why don't we just adopt the exception without reference to labels like felony or misdemeanor but go back to whether or not the protection was necessary and the crime reflected the issues that the common law thought important to justify warrantless entry?
",0.457038938999176
1235,20-18,Elena_Kagan_,4390.875,4414.38," Ms. Rice, if you look at our Fourth Amendment cases, you read them as a group, over and over and over they all talk about the home as the the sacrosanct place, the place of greatest protection. Everything else is compared to that and found not to be quite the thing that the Fourth Amendment protects. That's the central thing. Do you do you disagree with that?
",0.21625883877277374
1236,20-18,Elena_Kagan_,4416.22,4432.57," Okay. So, if I understand your argument, the way you kind of get around that is is by saying that in these hot pursuit cases the suspect makes a decision to go into the the home. It's almost a kind of waiver argument. Is is that what you're you're saying?
",-0.27170073986053467
1237,20-18,Elena_Kagan_,4450.335,4485.745," I I guess what I'm thinking of is this: I'm trying to see why we would make any kind of distinction between this sort of case, where the encounter begins in public and then goes into the home, and take another kind of case, which is which is Payton, where where the holding, of course, was that the police can't enter a home to arrest a felon without a warrant or without exigent circumstances, even if the felon is doing a crime right in his home. So why would we distinguish between the two?
",-0.08288996666669846
1238,20-18,Elena_Kagan_,4508.84,4544.61," But I guess that's what what I'm I'm suggesting, that there's really no distinction at all. In the Payton case, the the the person is also making a decision to do the crime, you know, let's let's say that he is engaged in a massive fraud and he's he's decided, hey, what a great idea, I'm going to use my home to do this rather than my office. So, I mean, you have the same kind of thing where the person is basically leveraging the fact that the home is protected, you know, in order to get greater protection. And yet, in Payton, we said doesn't matter.

",-1.0427192449569702
1240,20-18,Neil_Gorsuch_,4629.08,4667.235," Okay. I'm sorry to interrupt, but just given our limited time, given that there is no common law authority for the rule you propose of any and all misdemeanors or the rule that the Solicitor General proposes, presumptively for any and all, if we can accept that, accepting that there are also some concerns about what breach of the peace or escape meant, I guess I'm back to where Justice Sotomayor is. Why would we create a rule that is less protective than what everyone understands to be the case of the Fourth Amendment as original matter? Why would we adopt a rule we know is wrong as an original matter?
",0.3319277763366699
1241,20-18,Neil_Gorsuch_,4673,4686.58," Well, I I I thought we just agreed that that there is no rule at common law that any and all misdemeanors allow entry of the home in exigent in in hot pursuit or the Solicitor General's view. I thought that was common ground. I'm sorry.

1242,20-18,Neil_Gorsuch_,4725.96,4776.145," Well, I guess I I guess I'm still stuck where I was. I don't know why we would adopt a rule that's less protective than the original meaning. But let me ask you another question. You raise concerns about an officer's ability to distinguish between felonies and misdemeanors as one reason for your rule. But there's also the line between misdemeanors and infractions that are non-jailable. And if misdemeanors and felonies have proliferated in recent years, the number of these infractions has skyrocketed. Non-jailable traffic offenses, fire code violations you choose. Rabbits. Does your rule allow an officer to enter the home for a violation of a regulatory rule as well and, if not, why is drawing that line preferable to drawing the misdemeanor/felony line?

First, I want to explore how much is really at stake or how much of a difference there would be between the two positions here for officers on the ground in the wake of our decision. So I understand your position to be that there should be a rule, a categorical rule, and it seems to me the reason to have a categorical rule is because often, if not always, there will be some kind of exigency involved when you've had a how a hot pursuit, destruction of evidence, danger to others, escape of the suspect. I guess that cuts both ways, though, because one could say, well, you don't need a categorical rule because you already have the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine that covers all the things that justify the categorical rule. So I guess I'm wondering what the real difference in practice would be between a world where we have a categorical rule and a world where we allow all the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine cases to apply as they exist now.
",0.5922936797142029
1244,20-18,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4914.43,4976.07," Let me ask you a question now about methodology, a word, the original meaning of the term ""unreasonable"" in the Fourth Amendment. It seems to me that's a different kind of term than ""search"" or ""seizure"" or ""cruel and unusual,"" and ""unreasonable"" means unreasonable. So what we're really talking about is not original meaning or original intent or even original expected application because I don't I'm not aware of anyone in the first Congress or in the state ratifying processes that said ""unreasonable"" means the common law, unlike and the text is unlike the Seventh Amendment, which refers to the common law expressly. And Professor Lafave and others have pointed this out. So it's not really original meaning or even original intent. It's more like presumed original expected applications, like a Justice Douglas-style interpretation. No offense to Justice Douglas, but a little more free-form than what we usually talk about when we talk about original meaning. I just want to get your response to that.

I have a question about whether what it meant to breach the peace, you know, so that seems to be kind of a capacious category, and there's some dispute about what would fall within it.

I thought your brief was a little bit equivocal about whether your concept of pursuit would require knowledge that you were being chased or not. So is your rationale for this that, you know, someone who well, the cop could have arrested the defendant in public, and so the police officer can follow the defendant into the house to finish in private what was started in public?

1250,20-18,Stephen_G_Breyer_,5468.39,5554.18999995," Well, I talked I I asked last time, I want you to think of the cruel trilemma, okay? There is a fourth possibility which your words nearly always suggested, and that is that we what do you think that we could say, yes, it's almost always exigent, almost always, because all almost always the police departments have rules and almost always it is a felony and almost always there is a good reason for it, dah, dah, dah. And but we go back to the Constitution's words, ""reasonable,"" ""unreasonable."" It can show that it is not reasonable in the circumstance and there'd be a number of different things you'd bring into that and one would be the the length of the of the chase, was it just two steps or not. Another would be the type of conduct that led to the chase. So, if it's a rabbit type of conduct, that's a pretty strong reason against allowing that chase into the house. And another would be the availability of the magistrate and the risks of escape, dah, dah, dah. But you point out they'd only come up in a few cases. They don't normally chase people for minor things. But just leave it at that and say reasonable and we don't have an absolute rule. We thought we could answer this, but sometimes you just can't. What do you think? I'm not saying I'm for it. I just want to know what you think.

If IRS officers went to someone's office to arrest the person for tax evasion and the person slipped out and there was a chase, the person went to his house, would it apply would it be open to that person to say that that that you should have gotten you needed to get a warrant in that situation?

1253,20-18,Sonia_Sotomayor_,5756.3,5845.58," I continue to wonder why the dicta in our cases should control or make from dicta make the assumption that the mere commission of any felony justifies entry into a home even in in hot pursuit circumstances if the pursuit is not so hot. And and maybe we I'm going back to what Justice Alito started with earlier in saying we really do need to understand what those terms mean to decide this case and make an absolute rule. Your presumption, it sounds like you want to make it a legal presumption and one that needs to be rebutted by the Defendant. But I don't know why we would create a legal presumption, Ms. Ross. Why don't we just speak practically and say that there are some circumstances where that, in many circumstances, it might be justified to go into the home, but in some they're not, and leave it at that. I'm not sure why we go we need to create a legal rule.

1254,20-18,Sonia_Sotomayor_,5870.39,5891.34," Ms. Ross, the Second the First Amendment by its nature creates judicial review because it speaks about reasonableness and unreasonableness. These categorical rules seem to destroy that that presumption of the First Amendment. And I don't know why we should be creating more when the common law didn't.

1255,20-18,Elena_Kagan_,5930.27,5993.035," I want to press on that a little bit, Ms. Ross. I mean, I guess the two questions that I have about this presumption of yours is where does it come from and why is it needed. On the where does it come from, we we we we look at Fourth Amendment law and we just don't generally see the Court talking about presumptions, in a couple of non-majority opinions in this extremely sui generis area of drunk driving, but otherwise there's just no tradition in Fourth Amendment law of using presumptions, as opposed to case-by-case analysis of reasonableness. And and why do you need it? There are plenty of doctrines that say to a police officer, you know, when in doubt maybe you can take a little bit more of a risk. Qualified immunity does that. In this case, there's the fact of the good-faith exception lurking in the background. Why would you need a presumption rather than just like you should make your best shot? You should you should make the call that you think is appropriate.

1256,20-18,Neil_Gorsuch_,6075.765,6112.44," Good morning, Ms. Ross. I'd like to return to the question I I raised with Ms. Rice earlier and one of them at any rate and that is you you make a point about the difficulty of an officer's ability to distinguish between felonies and misdemeanors. But there's also a line between misdemeanors and infractions, and they are multitudinous infractions these days. Do you, like Ms. Rice, take the position that an officer can presumptively or absolutely in in her case proceed into the home in hot pursuit of a of a violation of an infraction?
",-0.38611698150634766
1257,20-18,Neil_Gorsuch_,6150.69,6188.585," So, if we put that together, that an officer can go into a home to arrest for an infraction, a non-jailable infraction, we live in a world in which everything is illegal, you put that together with the good-faith exception and the the fact that an officer's not being tested on his subjective intentions, which may be nefarious, but whether a reasonable officer could think as he did, and a hot pursuit can be pretty tepid, it turns out, have we come pretty close to doesn't that sound a bit like the general war world and and the founding that the framers were so concerned about rejecting?
",0.7567005753517151
1258,20-18,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,6211.59,6287.3," Good morning, Ms. Ross. I think we have a couple of options here people have explored, but I want to just narrow it down to two, and it's not going to use the word ""presumption."" But, if if I think there are two options here, one is categorical rule for felonies and exigent circumstances for misdemeanor cases. So that's one option. The other option's a categorical rule for both. And I asked Ms. Rice about this, what would be the difference in the real world. She said, as you said, clear rules for officers. But I wonder if the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine, in other words, the first option, really wouldn't provide, you know, not as clear a rule but still a pretty clear rule for officers because the Exigent Circumstances Doctrine really, as I see it, tracks common sense, these are the kinds of cases and the kinds of reasons an officer would do this in the first place, want to go into the house without a warrant, especially escape of the suspect, threats to others, destruction of evidence. So I guess I'm not sure what's gained by a categorical rule. That said, I'm not you know, I think it's also you can pose that question in the other direction I'm not sure what's gained by not having a categorical rule. I'd appreciate your analysis of that.
",0.538611114025116
1259,20-18,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,6326.41,6340.78," The one caution, though, is that will leave that'll leave the category of extreme cases, where an officer did not use common sense, is still covered by by the doctrine. And that seems problematic, as several people have raised.

1260,20-18,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,6373.82,6388.055," Good morning, Ms. Ross. Is your rule can I summarize it this way, that you think it's categorical for felonies plus presumptive for misdemeanors, or would you say just presumptive for everything, but we understand that for felonies it's always going to be satisfied?
",-0.8802295923233032
1261,20-18,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,6404.71,6449.2," Well, then I have a methodological question about the categorical rule for felonies. So we're all in agreement that at common law this exception applied for felonies. But, you know, common law, the list of felonies was pretty short. Why do we take and as we've pointed out again and again and again, today, the line between felonies and misdemeanors can seem quite arbitrary so why would we pull out as the key fact something's designation as a felony? Why wouldn't we simply say, okay, for the very serious crimes that used to be felonies at common law, then this rule applies, but otherwise the felony/misdemeanor line doesn't really have much significance here? In other words, why is it felony rather than the list of particular crimes that justify warrantless entry into the home?

1263,19-968,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,135.16,171.885," Counsel, I want to understand the scope of your argument first. Say you go into court and say your rights have been violated. The judge asks: How have you been damaged by that? Do you have any compensable injury? You say no. And he asks: Is there any is that violation going to have any effect on you in the future? And you say: No, it's not going to be repeated. And he says: Well, then you don't have standing, I've got to throw the case out. And you say: Oh, well, throw throw in a buck.

1265,19-968,Clarence_Thomas_,264.605,293.695," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to turn to something slightly different, counsel. In in Flanigan, the Eleventh Circuit precedent that that that the court followed, the court of appeals, the there was no enforcement of the of of the the ordinance involved. Does that make a difference here?
",-0.8011236786842346
1266,19-968,Clarence_Thomas_,316.955,341.14," So we have said and this is somewhat a different version or similar to the Chief Justice's concern we've said that that an injury has to be real and substantial. But, if you're only asking for a a dollar or nominal damages, doesn't that seem to undermine the real and substantial requirement?

Well, as as you are aware, Congress passes lots of statutes and they have tens of thousands of words, and people frequently think that one new set of words is is unconstitutional at least as enforced. We're not supposed to give advisory opinions. But, if somebody comes in in the con course of conduct under the statute or what they're going to follow, why why is not going to be done anymore. It's the same question as the Chief's: Why why isn't that just an advisory opinion? And you can say, well, he's hurt. All right. Is Bradford hurt? I see the first part, the first plaintiff. What about Bradford?

They think it could be applied to me. I think it's I think it is unconstitutional.

1269,19-968,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,512.94,585.07," You have said that nominal damages serve to vindicate a past violation of a constitutional right. And it would be helpful to me if you could perhaps explain more specifically what you mean by the vindication of a constitutional right that was violated. Do you mean simply a statement that there was a violation, which sounds a lot like an advisory opinion, or do you mean the award of some damages for a real concrete violation that can't be easily monetized? So, if a person is told you cannot speak about a certain subject and that's a violation of a constitutional right, there may not be any way to monetize the the violation the the harm that is awarded to the person, but is the theory that nominal damages assign a certain monetary value to this harm that can't easily be quantified in monetary terms?
",-0.3336702287197113
1270,19-968,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,611.825,647.64," Well, then the challenge for you is to show that early English and American nominal damages cases were based on that theory. Now Respondents say that they fall roughly into two categories: cases where nominal damages served as prospective relief from ongoing or future harms and cases where they were merely a consolation prize for failing to prove compensatory damages. Very briefly, what would be your best case or your best cases to show that that's an an incorrect understanding of the common law situation?

1271,19-968,Sonia_Sotomayor_,668.93,702.77," Counsel, the government, at page 30 of its brief, says that if a defendant moved for entry of judgment on a plaintiff's nominal damages claim, ""a district court"" and I'm quoting quoting them ""should enter judgment on the basis of the defendant's concession alone, without adjudicating the merits of the constitutional claim."" Your reply brief didn't address that argument by the government directly. Do you think that's possible? And, if it's not, why not?

1272,19-968,Sonia_Sotomayor_,709.775,725.93," Well, that's the question. If no, how about if the defendant deposits a dollar in an account payable to your clients, and the district court enters judgment on that basis? Would your claim then be moot? That was what the government was arguing.

1273,19-968,Sonia_Sotomayor_,737.74,755.74," if it's a tender, do you what would require that tender to be more than the compensable damage of one dollar? Would you require an admission of liability as well? And what in our case law would require that?

1274,19-968,Elena_Kagan_,909.615,950.83," I guess I always thought that that our Article III requirements meant that people can't bring a suit for pure vindication alone, for just saying, you know what, I was right, you were wrong, for the psychic satisfaction that it gives to hear a court say that. And I guess I wonder, if this is not, by your own admission, compensatory damages, how is it that we're not in that world, where the where the suit really is one for, you know, just a a a declaration that somebody else committed a wrong?

They point out that your client initially had a compensatory damages claim as part of this lawsuit. Why aren't they right? Perhaps your client has scruples against seeking more than a dollar and others might as well, but why should the law care about that?

I want to pick up on Justice Sotomayor's questions and try to figure out what's really at stake on this issue. Judge Jacobs in the Second Circuit opinion in Amato and Judge Henry in the Tenth Circuit opinion in Utah Animal Rights, their separate opinions, both suggested, as the government does here, that there's not much at stake because a defendant can always surrender to the judgment on the nominal damages claims when no other claims remain, and the district court simply enters judgment without adjudicating the merits. Justice Sotomayor asked you this, but I want to probe deeper on the answer. Isn't that exactly right?

And, I mean, I I understand that they are not compensatory damages, you know, that they they are distinct categories and you can't prove them with specificity, can't prove nominal damages, I mean. But I would have thought that your argument depended on nominal damages being retrospective. I I took your argument to be that they were compensation for a hard-to- quantify or impossible-to-quantify harm. So can you explain a little bit more why you are not describing to Justice Kagan that nominal damages are backward-looking relief?

Now I want to go back to your colloquy with Justice Breyer, and he was talking to you about Bradford's claim and asking why that wouldn't be moot. Can you identify any situation in which a case would be moot if the plaintiff also sought nominal damages? Putting aside Bradford's particular one, is there any case that would be moot if nominal damages were attached?
",-1.0780771970748901
1281,19-968,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1338.27,1358.81499995," Why not? Because you can always come up I mean, you were coming up with reasons why Bradford might have suffered some some damage. It's then hard to conceive of any any suit that sought prospective relief, like a declaratory judgment, or injunctive relief that had a tag-along claim for nominal damages that could survive sorry, I mean that would be mooted.

We have always been adamant about the necessity of addressing standing or, you know, the flip side of it, responding to mootness concerns before reaching the merits. But, if you have you have a case where there's no compensable damages, there's no concern about future injury, no no repetition, and all that's on on the books assume nominal damages as, you know, in name only, is a ruling on the merits, then the standing inquiry and the merits inquiry are precisely the same. Why is that not right?

You know, you immediately discuss the the the merits. Having your speech suppressed is an injury. What we always do is look for for standing first. Okay. You say something bad has happened to you. How have you been injured? What gives you the right to come into federal court? I don't think you can answer your injury question without saying this is the resolution of the merits, and that violates the principle that standing and the absence of mootness are issues that have to be addressed before the merits.

You suggest that the defendants in these nominal damages cases should just basically surrender and accept the judgment. But wouldn't that open them up to attorney's fees?

Now you won't do it anymore, but I bring a lawsuit for trespass. I can't measure the damages. And nominal damages always have been given there. The opposite situation, what we have are 400 million laws, actions, policies, and let's take the subset where we don't know whether it violates the Constitution or not. We don't know. Border case. In those circumstances, if you bring the courts into every single case, they would spend an awful lot of time adjudicating those cases, though nobody is really hurt, when there are lots of people who are really hurt who need their time and effort. Okay? So we have to draw a line. And the Eleventh Circuit's line, not perfect, but a line, is allow it if you also could plead a claim for compensatory damages, which I think they did here. I don't know why nobody said that. But but, nonetheless, that's their line. Now, if you don't like that line, you tell me what's a better line.

1290,19-968,Elena_Kagan_,2198.72,2292.325," General Mooppan, you have a lot of history on your side, but I think I want to give you a theory about why that history is not very relevant. I think that these cases that you have fall into three groups. The one are they are declaratory judgment actions in a world before declaratory judgment actions. In other words, they're ways to try to determine legal rights going forward before the declaratory judgment form existed. The second group of cases are cases in which there's injury that's hard to monetize, and and these cases are asking for something to recompense that injury. But the reason why those cases aren't very relevant anymore is that, in our world, we monetize those claims all the time. We now live in a world, unlike the historical world, in which we acknowledge claims for emotional distress, claims for dignitary harms of all kinds, which makes the nominal damages claim unnecessary. The third group of cases is a case in which what the plaintiff really wants is vindication. It's a statement that I'm right, the defendant is wrong. And as to those cases, modern Article III jurisprudence says that, you know, you don't that's not a case or controversy.

So that leaves me with the strong suspicion that attorney's fees is what's driving all this on both sides because, under Buckhannon, correct me if I'm wrong, if you sue for injunctive relief, the defendant changes the policy, as happened here, you get no attorney's fees, correct?
",-0.1966465264558792
1294,19-968,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2555.32,2570.92," Right. So what seems to be driving this is that the reason the plaintiffs want nominal damages, plaintiffs generally want nominal damages to be available, is attorney's fees, and the reason defendants do not want them to be available is they don't want to pay attorney's fees, correct?
",-0.964828610420227
1295,19-968,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2586.7,2610.045," Got it. Okay. And then Judge Jacobs and Judge Henry, though, say and I think this cuts in favor of your ultimate position here but they say the attorney's fees can be a concern of allowing nominal damages can be handled and already have been handled under Farrar by saying you don't get much in the way of attorney's fees when you get nominal damages. Is that how you see it?

1296,19-968,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2670.625,2690.745," Mr. Mooppan, last term, in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, we held the case, the Second Amendment challenge, moot because the City of New York changed its policy. Was that then really just kind of a technicality? If the pistol association had sought nominal damages, would that case have had to come out the other way under your theory?
",-0.5235448479652405
1297,19-968,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2714.705,2754.095," Okay. Well, then let me circle back to some of the questions that various of my colleagues were pressing Ms. Waggoner on. You had Justice Breyer, and then I asked this question. We're trying to get Ms. Waggoner to identify any case that would ever be moot under your theory so long as nominal damages were sought. What another way of getting at that point is, no, the majority of circuits do accept your theory and say that there that nominal damages can keep a case live or, put differently, that seeking nominal damages, a plaintiff would have standing to seek nominal damages alone. So, in that majority of circuits that follow the rule that you want us to adopt, do cases moot out?
",-0.635485827922821
1298,19-968,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3001.885,3023.975," Yeah. Well, then today you're saying that, or under today's legal regime, that if you ask for nominal damages, you're really just asking for a declaratory judgment. And if there's some reason a declaratory judgment is not available, then the nominal damages are not sufficient. In other words, it's just using the wrong label for the type of action you're bringing.
",0.49558550119400024
1299,19-968,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3151.715,3165.29," Well, I mean, is your answer the same with the allegation that, you know, for the gas that it took to drive the three blocks to to the to the campus or something like that, would you say that's just too small?
",-0.19959290325641632
1300,19-968,Clarence_Thomas_,3329.685,3359.425," In in this case at the Eleventh Circuit, the the court of appeals seemed to dispose of this simply with with Flanigan, by citing Flanigan's. And I don't quite understand why that case should cover this case, where there was actual enforcement here but no enforcement in Flanigan's.

Smith, his hostile neighbor, regularly picnics on Blackacre, and then he dies or some unfortunate thing. He's never going to do it again. Well, what's the damage? I mean, all he did was picnic. Pretty hard to measure. And so nominal damages. Or a college says: You can't pray here, young student. And imagine that policy is unconstitutional. And suppose he was stopped from praying. What's the damage? Can you say there was no damage? There was. But what is it? How do you measure it? I don't know. And the same with speech. He wanted to speak there. He was constitutional unconstitutionally forbidden to do it. Well, he was about to give his speech. What's the damage? Now don't nominal damages have a place right there where there is damage, but it's just impossible to measure?
",1.0390669107437134
1302,19-968,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3527.66,3548.28," Right. I accept what you say there. It wasn't the theory of common law, hypothetically, but isn't it a fairly good line to draw to keep the to keep the cases out of a court, where all you have is a theoretical argument that this is unconstitutional and never hurt you from --

1303,19-968,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3653.885,3679.9," Let let me pick up exactly where you left off. So let's say Congress amends 1983. It says whenever a violation of the First Amendment is proven, a past violation, plaintiffs shall be awarded statutory damages of one dollar. You would say there is no there is no standing there because that's that sum is too low, is that right?
",-0.32227301597595215
1304,19-968,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3727.44,3750.73500005," So your your answer to cut to the chase, your answer is that statutory that when there is injury-in-fact and there must be injury-in-fact, statutory damages cannot be awarded unless they can reasonably be regarded as a quantification, a monetization of the amount of the harm, is that it?
",-1.220218300819397
1305,19-968,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3931.97,3987.265," Counsel, in addition to the questions that Justice Alito had, it seems that your argument doesn't make any sense of other of our precedents where we held and you don't dispute in your briefing or here that the award of punitive damages can qualify you to have standing. But we very clearly have stated that punitive damage damages are not to compensate the injured party but, rather, to punish the tortfeasor and deter him and others from similar extreme conduct. If a case has been mooted because an act is not capable of repetition, there's no need to impose punitive damages, no matter how reprehensible the conduct may be. So I don't know how you can concede that punitive damages give you standing under your theory of the case.
",0.530103325843811
1306,19-968,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4049.04,4104.265," my my problem, counsel, is that then you're talking about quantifying an amount of damage, the ex-ante. You're basically saying one dollar's not enough, when we've said, even for compensatory damages, that no matter how small your injury, and even if a jury gives you one dollar, that that would be enough as compensatory damages, not nominal damages. You've proven an injury. And nominal damages are directed to be paid to the plaintiff. He or she may not think they got too much. I certainly presided over many cases in which the jury's award was infinitesimally small compared to the claimed injuries, but you can feel compensated. I don't understand why one dollar is not viewed as a form of alternative compensation.
",0.9522520899772644
1307,19-968,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4148,4177.195," But neither counsel, we go back to the to the starting point of my question. Neither are punitive damages. They're not viewed as compensation. But what they are is a measure of recovery. Whether we call it compensation, punitive damages, statutory damages, these are monies that are paid to the plaintiff. Whether it's one cent or 100 million dollars, it's still money that the plaintiff is entitled to receive.
",-0.04180934280157089
1308,19-968,Elena_Kagan_,4228.88,4259.615," I mean, that makes it sound like it's a dismissal of the plaintiff's claim almost, you know, like the libel suit where, well, technically, you committed libel, but you really don't have any damages because you're, you know, such a terrible person to begin with. But that's not mostly what we're dealing with here. I mean, I I would have thought that most of these suits that we're talking about are suits where the dollar is actually symbolic of of of your winning, of vindication, not of nothingness.
",1.2580560445785522
1309,19-968,Elena_Kagan_,4287.15,4306.27," let me give you a case. I don't know what what case who this cuts in favor of, you or the Petitioners, but I thought I'd ask it because it's the most famous nominal damages case I know of in recent time, which is Taylor Swift's sexual assault case. Do you know that one?
",-0.5569214224815369
1310,19-968,Elena_Kagan_,4307.15,4342.445," Yeah, you know, it was a few years ago, and she brought a suit against a radio host for sexually assaulting her, and she said, I'm not really interested in your money, I just want a dollar, and that dollar is going to represent something both to me and to the world of women who have experienced what I've experienced. And that's what happened. The jury gave her a dollar. And and it was it was unquestionable physical harm, but she just asked for this one dollar to say that she had been harmed. Why why why not?
",1.2101784944534302
1311,19-968,Elena_Kagan_,4356.98,4377.74," I thought you might say that, but then why isn't that the same as this? The Petitioner here said he was harmed. He wasn't able to speak when he should have been able to speak. And, you know, whether it's hard to monetize or it's not hard to monetize, he's just asking for a dollar to redress that harm.
",0.7660360932350159
1312,19-968,Elena_Kagan_,4385.73,4401.66," But these are just words. In the same way that Taylor Swift's harm compensated her, so too here. I mean, they don't really compensate anybody, but it's all the place of wants for a for for an acknowledged harm.
",0.6210159063339233
1313,19-968,Neil_Gorsuch_,4468.495,4498.925," Good morning, counsel. I'd like to kind of pick up there just so just so we start on an agreed slate. It isn't the amount that's the problem. One dollar isn't the problem. So, if the plaintiff here had introduced a a bus receipt for its fare of less than a dollar and demonstrated that was tied to his injury, that would count. And if Ms. Swift had come in with some sort of receipt of some kind, that would support her one-dollar claim, right?
",-0.43340015411376953
1314,19-968,Neil_Gorsuch_,4517.78,4595.735," Sure, I understand. I got that point. So I think the result is a rule that disadvantages perhaps two classes of persons particularly. First may be those like Ms. Swift who have some scruple or reason not to seek more, who could. And we have a lot of of amici briefs from religious groups that indicate, for example, that they have religious scruples against seeking damages for some injuries they've suffered. So they'd lose out, people like Ms. Swift and groups like that. And then it seems to me the second group that that that loses out are individuals whose claims are not sufficiently great to attract the attention of clever lawyers and economists to come up with damages theories. Emotional harm and distress is a particular example. Areas where it's difficult to quantify damages and expensive to do so require a large enough damage to justify the effort. So we disadvantage persons like that. It seems to me that's those are the kind of classes of persons exactly for whom nominal damages were designed in the first place. And can you can you respond to that concern?
",0.2556925415992737
1315,19-968,Neil_Gorsuch_,4605.13,4631.46," Well, I I I I fair. But perhaps they were designed, in part, to ensure that someone who had suffered a legal wrong does not lose out simply because of a failure of proof about damages. And I think that's often going to happen in that second class of cases I talked about where the damages are not great enough to warrant the work. So what do you say about that?
",-0.20461958646774292
1316,19-968,Neil_Gorsuch_,4700.265,4718.55," I thank you. One one last question I'd like to squeeze in quickly. You'd agree that in in those cases where we have the bus receipt showing 25 cents, less than a dollar, the attorney's fees problem recurs; you're going to have attorney's fees in those cases, so that can't be a good reason not to allow the fees, right?
",-0.3727288842201233
1317,19-968,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4725.205,4791.22," Thank you. And good morning, Mr. Pinson. Picking up on things that Justice Alito and Justice Sotomayor said, it seems that there are a number of things working against you here: potentially, the history, the common law cases; the precedent of this Court that seems to have recognized in certain situations nominal damages, cases like Carey that we'd have to deal with; the line-drawing problem that Justice Alito raised; in other words, how do we distinguish potential statutes Congress might enact that awarded a dollar or or that kind of statutory damages. And Justice Sotomayor asked about various forms of damages too. So we'd have line-drawing. And then one thing I wanted to ask you about, this seems to be working fine in all the other circuits that allow nominal damages. At least I'm not aware that there's huge problems. Is that incorrect? Just I realize that's not a legal point, more a practical point, but can you respond to that?
",0.008788256905972958
1318,19-968,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4827.86,4855.95," Well, let me let me ask you about that. And you, obviously, have answers to everything I just mentioned on the law, but some of the practical problems you've raised, and one of them right there, the extended or wasteful litigation, can't a defendant avoid that by paying the one dollar? The district court or the trial court enters judgment. That's not a judgment on the merits. It has no preclusive effect. What's the what's the problem with that approach?
",0.22866414487361908
1319,19-968,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4923.76,4971.15," Okay. And then, on the attorney's fees question that's been raised, those if those were fully available, then that would provide, obviously, an incentive for some plaintiffs to continue litigating even if there was no other injunctive or compensatory relief at stake. But my understanding of the case law, Farrar, and seems to be how it's applied in most lower courts, is that plaintiffs do not receive much in the way of attorney's fees when they only receive nominal damages, and, therefore, the incentive to litigate wastefully is not as present. It's not zero, I would acknowledge, but it's not as present. Can you respond to that?
",0.10711412131786346
1320,19-968,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5000.635,5071.185," Counsel, I understood in your briefing you to make two points about why nominal damages are insufficient under Article III, one being they're the prospective, not retrospective, point, these are really declaratory judgments, and then the other focusing on the amount and saying the very trivial amount shows that these really can't be compensatory. But it seems to me that, in your responses to Justice Alito's questions, Justice Kagan's questions, Justice Gorsuch's questions, you've kind of gone back and forth on the triviality of the money point. So, you know, you suggested to Justice Alito that at some point it's so little money that really should be taken into account. But, of course, our precedents say that, you know, even even a small amount is enough. And so, in the Taylor Swift example or in Justice Gorsuch's bus fare example, I I heard you at least I took you to concede that even a very trivial amount would constitute a compensatory injury under Article III. So is that part of your argument still with respect to nominal damages? Are you are you still hanging your hat on the amount, the one dollar being too little, and just exclusively focusing on the focusing on the prospective nature?
",0.0996486023068428
1321,19-968,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5112.265,5135.915," so what does the money have to do with it? Are we trying to figure out you know, Justice Kagan's question suggested that, really, what Taylor Swift wanted was, you know, vindication of of the the moral right, the the legal right, that sexual assault is reprehensible and wrong. Are we looking at the motivation for the suit, so could nominal damages actually be compensatory for one person but not for another?
",-0.5238406658172607
1322,19-968,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5183.51,5238.625," So what is the effect of your argument on the very, very many consumer protection statutes we have, like the Telephone Consumer Protection Act or the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act? You know, I I think, in those cases, statutory damages, we might think of them, you know, let's say it's 100 dollars, but you also get attorney's fees, as about vindicating, you know, a right and having a deterrent effect on, you know, the the industry. If Congress reduced that amount of statutory damages down to a dollar, I mean, I don't see why it's any different. So would this call into question whether those causes of action really are unconstitutional under Article III in many cases? I mean, you know, under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, you get a couple annoying texts. You know, that's that's pretty slight. As a statutory damage you know, if you seek statutory damages, are you seeking anything other than to to vindicate? Is that compensatory?
",0.42224422097206116
1323,19-251,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,134.54,173.03999995," Mr. Shaffer, your main argument is that we should apply strict scrutiny to the disclosure requirements here. But, with respect to political speech, which is we've held is, of course, at the heart of the First Amendment, when we have an issue of compelled disclosure, we apply exacting scrutiny. And doesn't it seem strange that when it's you're talking about charitable association, you would apply a more rigorous test than we apply to political association?

1324,19-251,Clarence_Thomas_,261.2,287.985," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, a couple of quick questions. How would it affect your analysis if the organization involved just did something that was not controversial, such as provide free dog beds or taking care of stray puppies or something like that? Would your analysis change in any way?
",-1.5645959377288818
1325,19-251,Clarence_Thomas_,349.45,381.68," This in this era, there seems to be quite a bit of quite a bit of loose accusations about organizations, for example, an organization that had certain views might be accused of being a white supremacist organization or racist or homophobic, something like that, and, as a result, become quite controversial. Do you think that that that that sort of labeling would change your analysis?
",-0.04693180322647095
1326,19-251,Stephen_G_Breyer_,477.04,535.86," Thank you. If you win in this case, I think the Court will have in some form held that the interest of the donors in maintaining privacy of their giving to a charity, interests of the charity in receiving those money, here at least outweighs the interest of the State in having a law on the books that, even if it never is actually enforced, frightens people into behaving properly. Okay? Something like that. Well, if we hold that, can we distinguish campaign finance laws, where the interest is even stronger in people being able to give anonymously? Can we distinguish laws that require them to disclose their givers? How would you distinguish that, if you would? And the other thing --
",-0.0799335464835167
1327,19-251,Stephen_G_Breyer_,536.38,573.745," I would like to hear you distinguish is just what Justice Thomas brought up. The IRS requires disclosure for tax purposes, okay, private disclosure. The California wants disclosure, so it has a potential for finding out, and that potential, as I said, might in and of itself discourage people from acting improperly in respect to to charities. So I'd like to hear the distinction, if you want to make them, between those two things.
",-0.37620437145233154
1328,19-251,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,815.555,834.15," All right. California had quite a few leaks in the past, but they now tell us that they've changed their practices and they're serious about confidentiality. What should we make of that? Should we hold them forever to their past breaches?
",-0.4362683892250061
1329,19-251,Sonia_Sotomayor_,881.605,938.09500005," Counsel, if we were to apply the type of narrow tailoring you advocate, I don't see how the public disclosure at issue in Doe would have survived. In Doe, this Court held that Washington State's requirement that signatories to referendum be publicly disclosed was substantially related to its interest in protecting electoral integrity. But, there, the State Secretary the State's Secretary of State pardon the redundancy checked signatures for fraud. That doesn't seem to be anything like narrow tailoring if that's what we were applying. It seems to me, as the Chief Justice pointed out, that McCutcheon is different than what we have been doing under exacting scrutiny. Under your theory of the case, though, Doe shouldn't survive.
",0.4919552505016327
1330,19-251,Sonia_Sotomayor_,989.7,1088.54," let me let me go to everything you're saying about California, okay? I assume that the vast majority of charities are not involved in fraud. You're seeming to assume that the numbers of cases in which this is useful has to be dramatically large because charities are dramatically largely committing fraud. What if I disagree with you, number one? Number two, the interest that California has in this schedule is, in part there was testimony by the head of the charitable organization and by the investigating auditing team that if you give out a subpoena or an audit letter, that it tips off and there has been history of these letters tipping off fraudsters and then hiding and then hiding their illegality. So the audit this this disclosure saves some time because audit and subpoena letters take them a long time to get the information. B, it helps them identify, when a report comes in of problems, whether it supports further investigation. And, C, it helps avoid the tipping that they're concerned about. Given that state interest, if the State had properly kept this nonpublic, why would it be not narrowly tailored?
",0.30799248814582825
1331,19-251,Elena_Kagan_,1188.175,1223.515," Mr. Shaffer, I'd like you to assume a set of facts with me, and they're this: that there are some donors to some charities who are genuinely concerned about public disclosure for fear of harassment or threats, but that a very substantial majority of donors in a very substantial majority of charities are not concerned about that. In fact, they rather like public disclosure of their generosity. If that's so, could you win a facial challenge?
",-0.7026386260986328
1332,19-251,Elena_Kagan_,1243.665,1264.095," Excuse me, Mr. Shaffer. I my premise is supported by a lot of facts. Most charities disclose their donors, and, in fact, it's part of their strategy, that the more disclosure there is, the more fundraising and association there is. So, anyway, let's just take my facts as a given --
",-0.24170081317424774
1333,19-251,Elena_Kagan_,1313.24,1328.695," I would have thought that a facial challenge, you need to show that, you know, some significant number of people in the world actually have this concern. And, otherwise, you should bring an as-applied challenge. I thought that that was the whole point of the distinction between the two.
",0.3396856188774109
1334,19-251,Elena_Kagan_,1342.545,1362.175," I I heard you say to Justice Alito that even if there were a guarantee that this information was never disclosed let's say that California had at least as good protections in place as the IRS does, better maybe.

I'm I'm I'm I'm positing I'm sorry, maybe I wasn't clear that two possibilities: One, fine, you get rid of this rule, but the AG issues a boilerplate request to organizations for the purposes of policing potential fraud, one. Two, that in the tax collection process, separate and apart from the AG, California starts mandating the disclosure of Schedule Bs.

",-1.3541165590286255
1337,19-251,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1835.25,1859.01," Kavanaugh left off. So what if you had a law, say, on a state university's campus, that made it illegal for anyone to engage in any speech whatsoever. But it was also the case that most of the students just shrugged and said, that's fine, I'm not planning to, you know, demonstrate or picket, and there was just a small percentage of people who were bothered by it. Would it be facially unconstitutional?
",0.7071846127510071
1338,19-251,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1875.86,1906.18," Okay. And this is where it relates to Justice Kavanaugh's question then. That's because it's an invasion of speech directly. So I'd like you to discuss a little bit how you conceive of this right. Is it an independent right, say, the freedom to associate and the freedom to associate anonymously, or is it simply, I mean, because showing chill makes sense if you're saying that this is simply to protect and this goes to Becket's amicus brief speech down the road? So can you describe a little bit the nature of the right that's at stake here?
",-0.048585616052150726
1339,19-251,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1973.86,2017.27," Okay. And I want to ask you something. You've repeatedly distinguished the IRS form from the California use of Schedule B because of the fact that it's, you know, kept strictly confidential and the IRS has a nationwide mandate. And you keep talking about the distinction between this not being a statute in California but being, you know, something that was I think you described it as subject to the executive's whim. And I guess I don't understand why all of those things matter. I would have thought state action is state action. So, if California, which has a state-wide mandate, passes a statute and, you know, as Justice Kagan asked you about keeping things strictly confidential, keeps it strictly confidential, it's done by statute, and it only applies to donors in the State of California, is that a different case?

Are they supposed to attach an affidavit or something saying we're a very controversial charity and we think, if people knew who gave money to us, they would be their rights to association would be chilled?

When you say ""come forward with,"" does that mean they file a statement saying we're a very controversial charity; to prove that, here are a number of examples where our donors were harassed? And and then somebody in the AG's office would make a judgment about it? I just I I just don't understand how it works.

What role would accusations that a particular organization is racist or is white supports white supremacy, that if that if there's a view of that organization to that with that reputation, would it be a chilling effect if these if its contributors think that that information or that their contributions to the organization would be disclosed, is it more than would that be more of a concern in that case than it would be, say, in the case of the organization that provides dog beds for adopted dogs or something?

What's the difference? If we hold in your opinion, the government's view if we were to hold against you and for the broader claims of the rule at issue in this case that the Petitioner brings, how would you distinguish disclosure in the campaign finance context? The right at issue, you heard Justice Thomas very eloquently explain that right, and it would certainly seem to apply as much. And the need in the political forum, money is involved in both cases, and the need to give anonymously would seem as strong, and you could argue about the government's interest. So, if that broad interest exists here, how would you and wins, how would you distinguish campaign finance, or would you?

1345,19-251,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2720.46,2742.315," Well, if it's not in the record, then does every nonprofit that fears its donors will be chilled have to do what these Petitioners have done, which is to take California to court and fight the state tooth and nail for more than six years in order to avoid potential public disclosure of its list of donors?
",-0.5348454117774963
1346,19-251,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2762.76,2788.77," Do you think that would provide adequate protection for First Amendment rights?

Do you think that's a legitimate fear in our current atmosphere, or or do you think it's paranoid?

1347,19-251,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2811.885,2865.5," Let me ask you about your position with respect to this particular case because I found it a bit puzzling. You say that the case should be remanded so the Ninth Circuit can consider ""how significant the harm would be to Petitioners' contributors if their identities became publicly known."" You know what the record here shows. The district court conducted a trial and it found ample evidence that the contributors to Petitioners would be harassed. And the brief filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and other groups says, ""Petitioners have shown that people publicly affiliated with their organizations have been subjected to threats, harassment, or economic reprisals in the past and are likely to be chilled."" What more do you think these Petitioners would have to show?

And it's and the question you think the Ninth Circuit didn't answer is do can do donors have a reasonable fear given the state's past disclosure problems, is it reasonable for them to be chilled? Is that what you're asking the Court to do?

",-0.6582972407341003
1350,19-251,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3017.285,3065.29," Now let me tell you how what I've been struggling with in this case, and perhaps you'll tell me if I'm struggling rightly or wrongly, given our what you believe our exacting scrutiny standard requires. It seems to me that what we look at first is, can a disclosure hurt a party? We don't generally, we ask three questions, but, if I take them backwards, we look at, is there a potential burden? And I think it goes without dispute in this case that the Petitioners have shown that a disclosure of their donors could harm them. I don't think you dispute that, correct?
",0.45916053652763367
1351,19-251,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3068.52,3113.69," That's the point. Now the question is, if it's not a public disclosure, which this law purports to be, we would balance whatever whether the state has a substantial interest, not a compelling interest but a substantial interest, in this information. And I guess the other side is saying, given the number of times we use it, even if it's small, 10 times, this is a substantial interest. It helps us in our law enforcement. So the issue really is, has the State proven that it's really not it's really going to keep this private? Isn't that the bottom line?

And as you answer that question, I'd like you to answer Justice Barrett's hypothetical, which is that, you know, it would seem irrelevant that lots of people don't care about a blanket restriction on speech. So why is that any different here?

1354,19-251,Elena_Kagan_,3286.875,3310.97," General, there's been a lot of confusion about what exactly exact what exactly ""exacting scrutiny"" means. You started by saying it's definitely not a least restrictive alternative test. Some people say, well, it has to be narrowly tailored. What do you think of that and and, you know, what's the proper level of tailoring in this context?

1355,19-251,Neil_Gorsuch_,3352.885,3397.05999995," Good morning, General. I I I guess I'm I want I want to poke a little bit further into this the the facial challenge question and your responses, as I understand your response that a charity would have to come forward with some evidence that it's likely to be harassed or that its donors might be. But doesn't that kind of put the the cart before the horse or invert the First Amendment analysis because you're placing donors and organizations, so the argument goes, in in the unenviable position of having to prove that they have been harassed in order to vindicate their First Amendment rights for privacy in associations?

1356,19-251,Neil_Gorsuch_,3414.67,3437.785," I understand those are nice words, but I I I'm I'm looking for something a little more concrete, General. How would you protect if if if you agree, as I understand you do, with Justice Thomas that the right to association includes a right to privacy in that association, how do you protect that when you're requiring donors and organizations to come forward to prove that they have been harassed?
",-0.4211941659450531
1357,19-251,Neil_Gorsuch_,3474.66,3516.9," So do you think, for example, then then that the government could compel private organizations to hand over their I don't know, some examples in the briefs I saw were their holiday card list so that it can ensure the accuracy of mail delivery or a young person's a list of the people they've dated so they can do a survey on marriage patterns? What would be wrong with, in in your view, those sorts of things, at least unless they come forward and show that they've been harassed or are very likely to be as a result of this disclosure? Why why isn't that put another way, why why would it be wrong to think of this as a problem of compelling speech?

1358,19-251,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3564.805,3620.955," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, General Prelogar. There's an impressive array of amicus briefs supporting Petitioners here across the ideological spectrum, and one of them is from the American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the Human Rights Campaign, among others, and that brief says and I'm going to quote you something and then get your reaction to it ""A critical corollary of the freedom to associate is the right to maintain the confidentiality of one's associations absent a strong governmental interest in disclosure. If the state could categorically demand disclosure of associational information, the ability of citizens to organize to defend values out of favor with the majority would be seriously diminished."" Your reaction to that amicus brief and the amicus briefs more generally that are supporting Petitioners?

1359,19-251,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3707.975,3775.08500005," And then, in terms of applying strict or exacting scrutiny, sometimes those words really are just asking the question, not answering the question. You're you're asking whether the state has an interest sufficiently compelling or important to warrant an exception to a constitutional right or to spell out the contours of the rights. And two things the Court has often looked to in applying that to state laws, say, in the free speech context and others is, one, whether the right the exception is historically recognized, that a right has coexisted with an exception of some kind historically, and the second thing, this the Court's often looked at, not exclusively, but has looked at, is how many states have also shared this same interest. So, here, I think there's not a historically recognized exception of this kind, although I want to get your response to that. And, second, what do you say about the fact that this right this California interest can't be all that important, so the argument goes, because 46 other states have not sought this kind of information?

Let's say that I agree that exacting scrutiny applies and that the Ninth Circuit didn't really engage in any kind of tailoring inquiry. I think what it did could more fairly be described as a balancing, balancing of interests. You kind of demurred a little bit when you were asked about what level, if any, of tailoring is required. So do you agree there has to be some kind of means-end fit or not?
",-0.4655683934688568
1361,19-251,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3900.74,3929.905," Well, General, let me read you this language from Shelton and tell me if you think that this you would agree that this is the standard we should apply when thinking about means fit. There, it the Court we said that, in evaluating means-ends fit, we struck down the law because we concluded that the government's purpose here is the quote ""cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifled personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved.""

1362,19-251,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3953.15,3982.35," Okay. Let me ask you about that predictive judgment then. So, in in pressing for as-applied challenges here or talking about whether this record adequately establishes that the Petitioners have reason or their donors have reason to fear retaliation, what if the Petitioners here had filed this challenge right at the beginning before any of these incidents of violence had occurred? How how is the State State supposed to judge whether there's chilling?

If if assume you have a charity that supports a cause that is controversial, and a number of organizations, people have said they will make life miserable for anybody who supports that charity. They'll picket outside their house. They'll boycott anybody doing business with them. If if that person came to you and said, I want to give a donation, but I want to be sure that California will not disclose this, that it will not get out, can you give me 100 percent assurance that that will not happen, what what would you tell that person?

Counsel, the I'm interested in your discussion of the nonpublic disclosure laws, the the fact that you would have this internally and not disclose it to the general public. But through you know, throughout at least recent history or not so recent history, the Japanese internment cases, that census data was used to locate them. The the Council on American Islamic Relations in their brief in this case say or allege that the U.S. Government used this data to to locate American Muslims. The in the civil rights cases, like the NAACP case, the local governments, state governments wanted data in order to target the So how can we say that there is a difference in in in public disclosure versus nonpublic disclosures?

1366,19-251,Clarence_Thomas_,4431.195,4465.415," With that in mind, do you think it would be reasonable for someone who wants to make a substantial contribution to an organization that has been accused of being racist or homophobic or white supremacist, that in this environment that they would be chilled because they have reduced or no confidence that their the their contribution will be kept confidential?
",-0.3302994966506958
1367,19-251,Clarence_Thomas_,4503.18,4520.14," So but you think that there is in in that calculus, do you include the possibility of an intentional leak by someone who happens to disagree with or dislike that particular group, that someone would consider that a possibility?
",-1.3162301778793335
1368,19-251,Stephen_G_Breyer_,4536.735,4613.14," What do I read in the record to show that this statement of the other side is wrong? I assume you think it is. The statement is, as I paraphrase it, there there is no need for this. You can't say there isn't some risk of leakage. It's never been necessary really or hardly ever, and at the very least, you could have a carefully tailored, a more like New York's, which is a more carefully tailored statute, the same thing. I thought the answer might be, Mr. Smith, the charity, goes and buys a piece of land or property in San Francisco or New York. It belongs to a major donor. Maybe he overpaid. Huh. This law means any charity will be very careful before they get into that fix. That's called, you know, preventative. But you don't make that argument. You're making the first. So what's the answer to the first? And why didn't you make the second argument? There's some good reason.

1369,19-251,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4765.125,4803.775," All right. The brief filed by the ACLU and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund says that we should regard your system as a system of de facto public disclosure because there have been such massive confidentiality breaches in California. And from the perspective of a donor, that may make sense. A donor may say: This is a state that has been grossly negligent in the past. No sanctions against anybody who's leaked this information. I have to assume that this may happen again. Why isn't that a reasonable way to look at this?

And let's take, as an example, the brief filed by the Proposition 8 Legal Defense Fund, where they detail evidence of vandalism, death threats, physical violence, economic reprisals, harassment in the workplace, the well-known case of Brendan Eich.

And that's one of the reasons, if not the reason, it issued the injunction, which the Ninth Circuit vacated. So what are we to do with that? I mean --
",0.3141709864139557
1372,19-251,Sonia_Sotomayor_,5014.2,5053.615," isn't that the nub of this? An exemption is only necessary if you're going to make it public, and, you're right, the district court has to determine whether your office has a reputation or a reasonable possibility that it's going to engage in political retaliation and leak it secretly, et cetera, et cetera. But what do we do with that finding, that given your past breaches you have essentially turned this into a public disclosure case?
",0.39648953080177307
1373,19-251,Sonia_Sotomayor_,5074.6,5111.28," Well, let me just give you an example. And and I think your someone said this earlier. It might have been the other side. How about if the requirement was that you hand-deliver this list to somebody in the AG's office who's going to put it in a locked file? Is that a guarantee better than putting it on the Internet with all of the anti-hacking procedures you have? There is a normal human fear about hacking, that they can hack anything.

You lost that below and we in the district court, and its findings are reviewed only under a clearly erroneous standard. And the district court said two things. It said there was a pervasive recurring pattern of inadvertent disclosure by California, and it said that the donors would likely be subject to threats and harassment if their affiliations were disclosed. So given those two findings, given a clear error standard, how can you win on the as-applied challenge?

You know, usually we don't allow parties, govern the government to come in and say, you know, we've reformed our ways. We've changed our practices. We'll do better in the future.

",-0.9351344108581543
1383,19-251,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,5682.17,5729.52," One thing we've looked at, the Court has looked at, in prior cases involving individual rights is in assessing the strength of the state's interest, is how many states have similar laws. And you heard me ask General Prelogar, and she had a good answer about each state has to assess its interests differently. But it still, doesn't it show that it's not really all that essential to a state's interests if 46 other states have seen fit to regulate without infringing on the right to assemble or the right to associate in this same way?

1387,19-251,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5921.39,5934.395," Well, I understand you think it's satisfied, but, in considering that means-ends fit, we look to alternatives and see what other less restrictive alternatives might be available, and it doesn't mean you have to choose the least one.

So we're at 250 organizations who filed briefs in support of the Petitioners here arguing that the disclosure mandate would harm their rights. Is that enough for a facial challenge? I I gather your position is no. So I'm wondering how many would it take?

They just want to take that off to avoid that risk, whether it's 25 percent or 98 percent. I don't know why they don't have sufficient standing to at least clear that up. Maybe their damages aren't terribly significant if, you know, no one else has seen the report, but it's kind of a surprising thing that somebody with misleading information about someone, that the whole point is they hope somebody asks for it because that's when they get paid, and you can't do anything about it.

Mr. Clement, if one of Petitioner's clients contracted to get the same OFAC in for designation information in a credit report and did not receive that for in any reports over a period of time, would that client have standing to sue Petitioner?

1391,20-297,Clarence_Thomas_,446.57,463.575," Well, I the I'll let that go for a minute. I you know, maybe with the FTC you're right. I don't necessarily agree with you, as I suggested in Spokeo on the other part. But let's go what would be your definition of your test for typicality?
",-0.3420351445674896
1392,20-297,Stephen_G_Breyer_,509.2,571.31000005," I'm interested in Justice Thomas's last question, thinking of typicality. I mean, all of these plaintiffs, in respect to every one of them in the class, the they they didn't in the first letter get all the information, they didn't get about the the terrorist related. And they said that the company didn't follow reasonable procedures. And they said in the second letter they didn't get the summary of rights. So they were all typical in that respect. But Ramirez also went out and tried to buy something and got into a lot of trouble, it was all complicated, dah-dah-dah. So, when the trial took place, would it have been possible for the lawyer for the company to have objected to the introduction of all that separate and special information about Ramirez on the ground that it had nothing to do, and was prejudicial, it had nothing to do with the typical injury suffered by the class?

1393,20-297,Stephen_G_Breyer_,610.15,642.275," No, I know what you think is the right way. But I'm just wondering why, in a class action, where the individual who is the named plaintiff, say, suffers a head injury, and nobody else suffers a head injury, and he wants to introduce that because it had something to do with the injury, you know, it's a relationship. But but can't you object to that? Why not? You say, look, that that might have been okay in an individual action, to bring that in, but this isn't that. This is a class action. Let's stick to what the class action harms were. Why can't you say that?

1394,20-297,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,716.95,744.635," Well, is there really no harm? Suppose someone gets this information, asks for the credit report, gets the information, and sees that the person has been flagged as someone whose name resembles the name of a person who's on this list. Doesn't that inflict some psychological injury on the person who gets that information?
",0.04466458037495613
1395,20-297,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,775.26,806.27," All right. Let me shift to a different subject. If we were to agree with you and this is an if that the district court should have certified only a narrower class, only those whose information was disclosed to third parties, can that be remedied simply by precluding recovery for those not in the class, or did that possibly overbroad certification hurt your client in some other way that can't be untangled?
",-0.8026016354560852
1396,20-297,Sonia_Sotomayor_,873.015,965.94," Counsel, I read Rule 23(a)(3) as requiring typical claims and defenses. Mr. Ramirez's claims were not subject to any unique defenses, and they were identical to every class member's claims. Everyone in the class was designated a potential match with someone else on the OFAC list because of the same unreasonable process, and everyone received the same two mailings in response to requests for their credit files. Now you object to Mr. Ramirez's atypical harms or potential individual damages. But I don't see where Rule 23(a)(3) requires typical damages, number one, so how do you square your argument with the text of the rule? But, number two, when you raised this issue before the district court, it suggested a verdict form that would let the jury award different statutory damages for class members who experienced different harms. That seemed like a very reasonable way to handle the situation. But TransUnion didn't ask for such a form. It didn't object to Mr. Ramirez's testimony or seek discovery from absent class members. I I just see this as a trial error, not as --

Does that satisfy Article III?
",-1.0155882835388184
1399,20-297,Elena_Kagan_,1153.6,1187.37," Yeah, so that's interesting, Mr. Clement, because that takes us back to the question that you and the Chief Justice were talking about. Now, in my hypothetical, unlike with the Chief Justice's question, you agree that retrospectively that there there is standing, right? So, if you if you just, you know you're you're within a five-year period, let's say, nobody knows who's going to get cancer, you're agreeing that everybody could be in that class action and that there would be standing, correct?
",-0.09073690325021744
1400,20-297,Elena_Kagan_,1207.09,1246.41," let's suppose that this cancer works so that you either get it or you don't in five years, and let's say that this suit is brought in the sixth year, still within the statute of limitations that Congress has prescribed, and it's still the same claim the the same class. There are both people who have gotten it and there are people who haven't gotten it. Now I would have said that if you're willing to give me that everybody has standing within the five years, it should be that everybody has standing in the sixth year as well because you have standing if you suffered harm in the past. And your concession is a concession that you have suffered harm in the past, isn't it?
",0.6796319484710693
1401,20-297,Neil_Gorsuch_,1394.125,1418.345," So okay. So your so your argument as I understand it then is, with respect to those in the the group that didn't that didn't have their information sent to third parties, that they need to have some knowledge of the information in order to have any material risk of injury. Is that is that a fair summary of what you're saying?
",-0.8650739192962646
1402,20-297,Neil_Gorsuch_,1462.945,1486.99," Okay. And then, with respect to the 1800 who did have their information published, when I look at, you know, the common law on defamation, publication was presumed to give rise to injury, the idea of, if something bad is said about you in public, a reason the the common law would presume an injury. Why wouldn't the same hold true here?

1403,20-297,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1528.87,1576.715," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Clement. To pick up on Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kagan's questions, let me make sure I understand the risk of harm. As I read your brief, you said the risk of harm is likely risk of harm alone is likely not enough for damages as opposed to injunctive relief. At least that's how I read Footnote 4 of your brief. In response to Justice Kagan and Justice Gorsuch, I think you were saying but tell me if I'm wrong that the risk of harm is still not enough for damages unless the risk of harm is itself a separate harm. In other words, the risk of harm is not cancer, in other words, you don't have the cancer, but the risk of harm may create emotional injury. Is that an accurate way to summarize what you're saying?
",0.163021057844162
1404,20-297,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1627.99,1645.185," To pick up on Justice Alito and also Justice Gorsuch, if we agree with you on the six 6332 people but don't agree with you on the 1853 people, exactly what should we say in terms of what should happen on remand?
",-1.0308901071548462
1405,20-297,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1688.51,1717.155," And then, in response to Justice Thomas, I think you're saying that the problem here is that Congress is setting up, in essence, a shadow government of private attorneys general to enforce prohibitions on certain activities by certain entities, and that's an Article II/Article III problem, and your test is no harm/no foul. But but how would you succinctly describe how we determine whether there is sufficient harm as a general matter, or can that be done in a in a general way?
",-0.43419528007507324
1406,20-297,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1769.01,1829.965," Mr. Clement, I want to ask you a follow-on to Justice Kagan's hypothetical about the people who drink water are exposed to a carcinogen, they're at 50 percent risk of cancer. She asked you to distinguish between what would happen if they filed within the five-year period in which they would know whether the risk had materialized or outside the five-year period, say in the sixth year. I want to know what would happen, say, if they filed in year two, but the litigation drags on and on and on and the case doesn't come to its conclusion until year six. So, if I understand your response to Justice Kagan, it would essentially mean that people had standing at the outset of the suit. But, if they were in the 50 percent that were home-free, they would lose their standing by the end? I mean, that just seems like an odd way to think about it since we normally judge standing at the outset, and when something dissipates over the course of a suit, we think about it in terms of mootness, not that the injury isn't concrete. Or is this a merits determination that they didn't suffer damages? How to how to think about that?
",-0.14057138562202454
1407,20-297,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1885.49,1944.16," Okay. Let me ask you about material risk of harm. So, as I read Spokeo, you know, and it cites Clapper after that language, it preserves, you know, the possibility of standing in a prospective suit where harm is imminent but hasn't yet happened. And then, for slander per se, you know, there are some harms that were recognized at the common law, as we have discussed during this argument, that were presumed to cause harm because, even if you didn't have to prove that you lost a job over it, you know, that the risk was so great that in and of itself the common law tort proposed it. And it seems like this case is about whether, even going beyond that, a big risk that the tort would actually happen to you is itself a tort. And I I haven't heard you disclaim that as a proper reading of Spokeo. Instead, it seems like you're talking about quantifying the risk, accepting that that could be an injury under Spokeo but only if it's an 85 or 90 percent chance of happening. Am I understanding you correctly?

1408,20-297,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2204.72500005,2233.49999995," You said in your opening that the class members were wrongly labeled potential matches to the OFAC list. But I don't see how that's true. They were potential matches, right? They had the same same name. ""Potential"" doesn't mean actual. And I don't see how it doesn't mean actual. And I don't see how it could be actual if they were accurately labeled potential matches.

1409,20-297,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2420.55,2508.52," I have the same question, just if you want to say more about Justice Thomas's last question. How is this different? I've always thought that a a a class of antitrust plaintiffs, all of whom have to pay higher prices as the result of price fixing, could be represented by a a consumer who, through an odd chance, bought a thousand times more of the product than anyone else in the class. He just had higher damages. Or a class action against somebody for doing something that would send a victim to an emergency room could be represented by a person who was not only sent to the emergency room but, through an odd set of circumstances, was actually sent to the operating room and had to be and had all kinds of bad it's the same basic harm; it's just a lot worse. Well, how does this differ from that? In the examples I gave, are they not typical? Or is is the is the defendant allowed to say to the judge, Judge, don't take those non-typical things into account, the extra damages, at least not until we find liability; then you can have a class for damages, or don't consider I mean, how does it work?

But let me shift to something else and ask about the class members' standing to assert claims for failure to provide the information called for by Congress. Mr. Clement says all the information was actually provided, but it was just provided in the wrong form. You may not agree with that. But is it your position that there is always injury-in-fact when information that Congress says must be disclosed in a particular form is not provided in that form but is provided in another form, and the recipient is well able to understand the information that's provided?

But, in answering Justice Breyer, you said that the problem was that Mr. Ramirez had testified at trial. So I guess the question that I have is, suppose he hadn't testified at trial, would there still be a typicality problem?
",0.013767830096185207

Or, alternatively, he could have had somebody else testify at trial, a different member of the class. I mean, there's no necessary relationship between who's the class representative and who testifies at trial. I mean, still a third alternative is that Mr. Clement's client could have called a bunch of other class members to testify at trial. The question of who testifies at trial really has nothing to do with who the class representative is, does it?

It wasn't Mr. Ramirez. It was a class representative with a perfectly typical injury. But then you said, I have this great idea, let's put Mr. Ramirez on the stand. I mean, he could do that. There might be some evidentiary objection. But it wouldn't be a a class objection, a class certification objection. So, again, the problem has nothing to do with class certification, does it?

So Congress has a statute that says notice needs to be provided in a particular form. The defendant provides it in a different form. Is that alone enough to create an injury-in-fact under Spokeo, or do you agree that something more needs to be shown, some risk of harm, some actual harm, something befell the plaintiff because the form of the information was different?

My understanding was that a risk of harm that is not itself a separate cognizable harm does not give you standing to seek damages, as opposed to injunctive relief, because you haven't been harmed.

I think Mr. Clement is suggesting and, certainly, the amicus briefs are suggesting on his side that Congress is, in essence, delegating to private attorneys general to enforce federal law against a wrong committed by someone to try to deter that wrongful behavior. And some of the amicus briefs say the problem is that the executive branch enforces federal law and that private plaintiffs can't do that, can't be delegated that authority by Congress unless they themselves have a concrete injury.

So, you know, Atkins and Public Citizen arise in the context of FOIA and and a right to information from the government. A lot of the courts of appeals who have recognized this idea of informational injury in the context of information to which a plaintiff is entitled from a private party also rely on Havens Realty. You don't. Why?

What is the concrete injury in my hypothetical? You you didn't know you were exposed to risk, but you didn't know it, and by the time you found out about it, you weren't.

One of the things we look for in determining whether there is Article III standing is whether there's any common law analogue, whether this was the kind of case that would have been recognized as an appropriate case in court at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.

1437,20-297,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4713.11,4817.09," Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Issacharoff. I think you have a good argument with respect to the 1,853 in terms of the reasonable procedures, but I'm more concerned about the 6,332, whose information was not, in essence, published. Under in Spokeo, of course, the information was published, which is a big distinction, as I see it, between that case and this, as to the 6,332. And when Spokeo talked then about risk of harm, it was talking about harm beyond the publication, at least as I understood it, for example, publication of ZIP codes, which strikes me as a very different thing than risk talking about risk of harm when there hasn't been publication to begin with. So that that's point one. And then, on on risk of harm, you heard me talk about damages versus injunctive relief. It strikes me that risk of harm, of course, is enough to get you injunctive relief. With damages, I I hadn't thought risk of harm would get you damages standing for damages claims unless the risk of harm was itself a harm. Judge Tatel in the D.C. Circuit analogized it: If inaccurate information falls into a database, does it make a sound? And his answer to that, applying Stoke Spokeo, was no. And I guess then-Judge Barrett, talking about no harm/no foul, seemed to be picking up on the same thing. So can you respond to the distinction between this case and Spokeo and then try to help me on risk of harm for the 6,332?
",-0.10248138010501862
1438,20-297,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4867.73,4887.23," In in Spokeo, though, I think, you know, there's different language in there, of course, and we're going to have to figure that out, but I thought the publication itself was the key demarcation that helped support standing there. And you don't have that here for the 6,332. If you can continue your answer to that.
",-0.17167413234710693
1439,20-297,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4953.41,5019.14," Good morning, Mr. Issacharoff. I have a question about whether you can ever have a bare procedural violation with respect to any of these consumer protection statutes, like FCRA or the FDCPA. I mean, all of them have procedures that are designed to protect against a risk of harm. So, you know, whether it's to have information put clearly on two pages instead of one or, you know, whether it's to say that certain things must be in writing or whether it's I'm thinking of many of the cases that the lower courts have dealt with not having so many numbers of your credit card receipt credit card number reflected on a receipt, all of these are designed to protect a consumer against the risk of some harm. So is there any violation that you can think of and I'm talking about I'm not talking about the disclosure here. I mean I'm not talking about the reasonable procedures claim and the disclosure of private information. I'm talking about these procedural guardrails like this. Is there anything that you can think of that would count as a bare procedural violation that's not cognizable under Spokeo?
",-0.1569613665342331
1440,20-297,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5061.81,5091.98," So then is it your position that the reason why there was standing for these things coming in the two envelopes and the OFAC envelope not having the specific information that was included in the first credit report is it your position that the reason why that's not a bare procedural violation as opposed to something else you didn't give an example, but something you say would be trivial is it because of the the it it being inherently shocking and confusing, like the Ninth Circuit said? Is that what distinguishes it?
",-0.05421736463904381
1441,20-444,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,152.03,170.795," So, if a judge a district court advises the defendant during the plea colloquy that murder is a strict liability offense and, you know, it doesn't matter whether he has the intent to kill or not, you think that you don't have a per se rule there, in a situation like that, that that would be structural error?
",-0.3841940760612488
1442,20-444,Sonia_Sotomayor_,599.99,666.99," Counsel, this is a very different kind of case than our other plain-error cases because, in our other cases, the defendant had a reason for putting forth a defense. So whether it was Neder, the defendant knew that someone had to find materiality. It was the same thing in Johnson. But this is the kind of case where no defendant knew that there could be an actual defense at all. So why wouldn't we find that a structural error? You're omitting the requirement of an offense at all. And even if we found it to be structural error under prong 3, why wouldn't you win under prong 4? Because assuming that a court can look at the entire record under prong 4, here, the defendant admitted to the probation officer that he and to the court, I believe, that he knew he was a felon. So don't you win either way?
",0.21999533474445343
1443,20-444,Sonia_Sotomayor_,709.23,729.74999995," Excuse me, counsel. Do you have the same answer to the questions posed earlier about the defendant who really didn't know or have an opportunity to create a record? Do you agree that we should look at those cases, even in a guilty plea, as different than in the normal situation that a defendant should be able to proffer evidence before the appellate court?
",-1.5150731801986694
1444,20-444,Sonia_Sotomayor_,743.075,773.445," I'm not asking you that because it never gets back to the district court unless the appellate court says that there was an error that sends the case back. I'm asking the question as if a defendant didn't know and didn't put into the record a plausible defense. Do you agree with your colleague in in Greer that that defendant could proffer that in the appellate to the appellate court?
",-0.25038111209869385
1445,20-444,Elena_Kagan_,784.93,845.685," Mr. Ellis, when you were answering the Chief Justice's hypotheticals earlier, you said that structural errors really all go to the overall structure of the proceeding and that's why none of the hypotheticals he gave you were, in fact, instances of structural error. But I had thought that there was a different category of structural error where what we were looking at was some interest that was unrelated to whether there was an erroneous conviction and, in particular, a category where we were concerned with autonomy interests, with the ability of a defendant to make his own choices. And in some of those hypotheticals that the Chief Justice was giving you, I would have thought that there was no such ability to make your own choices, that you have so little information in cases like that that the autonomy interest is raised to a very high level. So I'm I'm curious as to your response to that.
",-0.02735370397567749
1446,20-444,Elena_Kagan_,900.5,918.91," Well, go back, Mr. Ellis, to the Chief Justice's hypothetical, then maybe to a couple of of of different ones. You know, suppose a defendant pleaded guilty without being informed of any of the elements of the offense. He didn't really even know what crime he was pleading to. Would that be structural error because it interfered with his autonomy interest?
",-0.4053765535354614
1447,20-444,Elena_Kagan_,930.91,945.895," Well, how would he even know what to object to if he if he didn't know anything about what the crime was? I mean, how can a defendant make the choice to plead guilty if he doesn't know what he's pleading to? I would have thought that that's pretty non-autonomous decision-making.
",0.5275049805641174
1448,20-444,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1280.89,1304.4," You know, the cases where we've held that it's not structural error, I think, if you put them side by side with yours, it's hard to say that yours is necessarily stronger. You know, the judicial improper participation in the negotiations, the government's actual breach of the plea plea agreement, if those aren't structural, why why is the error in this case?
",0.0994788408279419
1449,20-444,Stephen_G_Breyer_,1350.7,1397.67," Yeah. What what what is the difficulty of of making what you made all these arguments. Fine. So the lawyer for the defendant says to the appeals court or the district judge, you know, we wouldn't have pled guilty. Now you have to make you know, you have to make it plausible or reasonable, or if it wouldn't happen, then that's the end of it. You win. I mean, why call it a structural error? Why not just say the plain error shows that it was likely it would have made a difference, end of case? But, in a case where there's an element, you know, it wasn't known about, et cetera, dah, dah, dah, but it's obvious it wouldn't have made any difference whatsoever, you lose? I mean, why is that a tough system to work?
",0.7985296845436096
1450,20-444,Stephen_G_Breyer_,1486.77,1512.19500005," No, but it was in the briefs. I mean, he says, look, judges in the appeals court, hey, I didn't know that there was this element, obviously. If I had known, I wouldn't have pled pled guilty. And then you put in a general description of of what makes that plausible, reasonable to think in the circumstance. You don't have to go into some big record. You just have to explain it and back it up.
",0.8202639222145081
1451,20-444,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,1625.935,1662.87," Well, why wouldn't the autonomy argument apply to any misstatement or omission, that at the Rule 11 proceeding, the judge explains to the defendant the rights that the defendant is giving up and what the government would have to prove if the case went to trial, and the defendant presumably makes a decision about whether to go to trial or plead guilty based on that understanding of what is at stake? And so, if the judge mis-describes what is at stake, it seems to me the same autonomy interest is implicated. No? What's wrong with that?
",0.007347948383539915
1452,20-444,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,1714.085,1751.12499995," On the issue of futility, if I understand the chronology, at the time when your client pled guilty, Judge Gorsuch's separate opinion in the Tenth Circuit on this issue had been issued and, in fact, had been on the books for a number of years, and Judge Gorsuch had become Justice Gorsuch. So why would it have been why was it futile to raise the issue at that time in the district court? Had that been done, we might be talking about Gary cases as opposed to Rehaif cases.
",-0.01755349338054657
1453,20-444,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1812.73,1860.005," Mr. Fisher, even assuming that this was structural error under prong 3 for the reasons that you stated or just narrowly because there was no reason for him to know that anyone would have to find this element and so no reason to proffer to consider this defense at all, don't you still have to meet prong 4? And I don't want you to argue Mr. Greer's case, but assuming that on prong 4 all evidence in the record could be looked at, tell me what defenses are plausible that your client could raise. You mentioned they may have been in your red brief. I just don't remember seeing what they were.
",0.19909530878067017
1454,20-444,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1880.625,1905.72," Here is a man who was convicted seven times, multiple separate jail terms, vastly exceeding one year, and I think he had been let out of his last conviction months before he was arrested on this charge. So what would have made it what factual defenses to knowledge would he have plausibly had?
",-0.3969610929489136
1455,20-444,Elena_Kagan_,1994.805,2018.855," Mr. Fisher, like Justice Alito, I'm also trying to get a handle on what you think is autonomy-infringing and why. So, if we could think about the error in Bousley, there, the Court advises the defendant that using a firearm in connection with a drug crime requires only gun possession. But that's not right. In fact, it requires active employment of the firearm. Is that structural?
",-0.03733314201235771
1456,20-444,Elena_Kagan_,2051.03,2065.005," or omission is not your your dividing line. So, for example, if the Court had told your client that a felon was someone convicted of a crime that carries a sentence of six months, that would be just as autonomy-infringing, is that right?
",-0.07416970282793045
1457,20-444,Elena_Kagan_,2127.325,2149.35," Is is is your view that this has nothing to do with the question of prejudice? I mean, imagine a case where we think, in light of the nature of the omission or in light of the nature of the mis-description, I mean, every defendant in his right mind would still have pleaded guilty. In that case, we're just not allowed to say that?
",0.10309646278619766
1458,20-444,Neil_Gorsuch_,2195.945,2239.72," Mr. Fisher, I'm I'm still trying to get my hands around your futility argument. The contemporaneous objection rule is heavily embedded in tradition and also in the Federal Rules. And Rule 51(b) speaks expressly to the question, and it says that there's no need for an objection if a party does not have an opportunity to object. That that's the test. It's not some sense of how many circuits have ruled against it or whether it's likely to lose or how likely it is to lose in front of the district court or in the court of appeals. It's an opportunity. And how do you how do you reconcile your argument with that language in Rule 51?
",-0.039525724947452545
1459,20-444,Neil_Gorsuch_,2254.91,2267.97," Yeah, I I I just haven't seen any of that from your brief. You mentioned a Second Circuit opinion, but there's nothing from this Court that's ever construed an opportunity to object to mean a likelihood of success on that objection.
",-0.1787799447774887
1460,20-444,Neil_Gorsuch_,2285.51,2300.62," Oh, an intervening decision, but but, here here, again, there there there was plenty of notice that this was an available argument out there. It may not be a likely one that the Eleventh Circuit was likely to have adopted, but --
",-0.21455088257789612
1461,20-444,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2379.895,2428.97," Thank you, Chief Justice. And welcome, Mr. Fisher. Just to zero in on this particular case and the precise issue in this case, I think you're saying that it's unfair to defendants to have their conviction by trial or plea when the government wasn't required to prove that the defendant knew he was a convicted felon. And the Fifth Circuit said, well, convicted felons typically know they're convicted felons. Judge Wilkinson said felony status is simply not the kind of thing that one forgets. So, from that premise, it seems odd to throw out all the convictions if you accept that premise. So do you accept the premise that convicted felons typically know they're convicted felons?
",0.6523931622505188
1462,20-444,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2576.925,2594.08," And so do you think that's kind of a natural weed-out mechanism for the point that Judge Wilkinson was making, that, you know, felon status is not the kind of thing that you were going to forget, so their the likelihood that they would succeed if, indeed, they won on appeal and went back and put the government to its proof is itself a deterrent against a flood of cases?
",-0.2670534551143646
1463,19-123,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,124.85,158.32," Ms. Windham, this is a case involving free exercise rights, but it's in they're in tension with another set of rights, those recognized in our decision in Obergefell. And whatever you think or however you think that tension should be resolved as a matter of government regulation, shouldn't the City get to strike the balance as it wishes when it comes to setting conditions for participating in what is, after all, its foster program?
",-0.14380976557731628
1464,19-123,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,188.64,213.485," you don't see any difference in terms of the analysis whether it's simply a regulation, the City issuing a rule that governs across the board, as opposed to part of the rules for participating in a program; in other words, not in its sovereign capacity but in a managerial capacity or, you know, a business capacity?
",-0.681749165058136
1465,19-123,Clarence_Thomas_,251.43,298.565," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, following up on the Chief Justice's question, this seems to involve both contractual relationships with the City, as well as, as the Chief said, regulatory or licensing. In that instance, when you have both aspects of that, do we analyze it as a government contract, again, referring back to the Chief's point, or as sort of a licensure program where the City has basically taken over an area and now it has certain requirements of the the regulated industry?
",-1.3613604307174683
1466,19-123,Stephen_G_Breyer_,373.125,444.34," Yes. Thank you. On pages 45 and 46 of the City's brief, they say that they aren't requiring you to endorse same-sex marriages. They say all they're asking you to do is evaluate a couple without reference to whether they are same-sex or not. You've read that. It says your objection is to being required to evaluate and provide written endorsements of a same-sex relationship. But they aren't saying to do that. Indeed, they say add something onto any response you make and say that you do not endorse same-sex marriages. Say it. You see what it says. So suppose pages 45 and 46 were written right into your contract, allowing you to say whatever you want about same-sex. All they want you to do is evaluate this couple irrespective of same or different sex. What is your religious objection to that?
",0.1301003098487854
1467,19-123,Stephen_G_Breyer_,531.775,605.605," Well, you don't have to say, according to them, whether the couple is married, whether it's not married, whether it's same-sex, whether it's different sex. You just put that to the side, make a note that you're putting it to the side, and say, other than that, they're okay or they're not okay. That's all you have to do. Now what's the problem? I still don't quite see it. You said in your response that you don't want to do it, which I understand that you don't. But they say they're imposing a requirement that does not interfere with your they can't figure out how does it interfere. And so we write 45 and 46 right into your contract word for word. And now tell me once again what's the problem. You in your last answer, you just said they can't make you say anything. I guess that's true. But we write 45 and 46 and say you can say something if you want, or you don't have to if you don't want to, but just take same-sex, different sex, and put it to the side and say, other than that, are they qualified.

1470,19-123,Sonia_Sotomayor_,820.54,851.42," Counsel, I'm interested in why you see yourself as a licensee as opposed to a government contractor. I understand that many governments throughout the country do these home assessments and certifications internally. They hire employees within the government, they set up criteria, and they're the ones who choose to certify a family or not. So why aren't you any different than a government contractor?
",-0.5924109220504761

It's a lovely argument, but I'm having a very hard time accepting how, when the City sets forth a set of criteria, only these people can do this work for me. That's not a license. That's an employment contract.

What is dangerous is the idea that a contractor with a religious belief could come in and say: Exclude other religions from being families, certifying families. Exclude someone with a disability. How do we avoid that? Or exclude interracial couples.

The certification process is who's eligible, and they don't require someone to have to be married even, same-sex or not. That's different than placing a child, which is governed by the best interests of the child.

I want to follow up on some of Justice Alito's questions and just make sure I have some of the facts down pat here. First, as I understand it, Philadelphia contracts with about 30 private foster agencies to find and train and support foster families, and Catholic Social Services is just one of them, as I understand it. And, second, if a same-sex couple ever came to Catholic Social Services, Catholic Social Services would refer that couple to another agency that works with same-sex couples so that the couple could participate and be a foster foster parents. And then, third, no same-sex couple has ever come to Catholic Social Services for participation in this program, and, therefore, Catholic Social Services' policy has never actually denied any same-sex couple the opportunity to be foster parents in Philadelphia.

1484,19-123,Stephen_G_Breyer_,1920.71,1977.985," Very well. I'd like to follow up on two questions that have been asked, the questions of the interracial marriage. Everything is the same except it's interracial. The response so far from your side has been, well, that's a compelling interest. This isn't. Think of other examples. The government wants to contract to a food distributor to supply food on all the military bases, and because they are Orthodox Jews, they want nothing to do with ham and don't want to let anybody else they want nothing to do with it. Or consider a a religion which says we're bidding on this contract for local transportation and we want men and women to sit separately, or we want women to wear head scarves. Now, in a contracting basis, is it your opinion that the government just has to do that, has to give into the religious belief, or not?

1485,19-123,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2015.53,2031.03," We can get other people to supply the ham, they say. And so they that's all right. But we can't do anything about this, the the the head scarves, and we can't do anything about the interracial marriage. So, in your idea, the well, how how does that work out?

1486,19-123,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2046.54,2072.44," I'm sorry. I want to interrupt you right here because now two of you have said this, that we should write an opinion which says discrimination on the basis of race, constitutionally speaking, is different than discrimination on the basis of gender, on the basis of religion, on the basis of nationality, on the basis of homosexuality, all right? Is that the opinion you want us to write?
",-0.30189263820648193
1487,19-123,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2165.22,2201.32," We don't reach constitutional questions as a general matter unless we unless we have to. That's a strong policy. But what do the arguments in this case about the complicated arguments about exemptions and the new arguments about contracting, the question whether Catholic Social Services is more like a regular licensee or more like a contractor, say about the stability of the Employment Division versus Smith precedent?
",-0.7162208557128906
1488,19-123,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2256.455,2308.38," Counsel, I've always thought that a compelling state interest that motivated our holdings in racial discrimination cases was not merely that race was important but that the burden on the people who are rejected because of race is an interest that the state could seek to protect, that a rejection on the basis of race or any protected category creates a stigma on that person and that it's a compelling state interest for the state to have an anti-discrimination law on the basis of protected classes. Are you are you diminishing that as a compelling state interest?

And the City has said to that couple: We won't discriminate against you, but CSS, our independent contractor, doesn't want to serve you, doesn't want to certify you, not on the basis of any of the criteria that the state has set forth. You might meet every criteria the state sets forth. But they're imposing an additional criteria.

1490,19-123,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2374.42,2407.045," I suspect that's part of part of that is just natural, meaning people gravitate to agencies that are known by their community. And so I am sure and this is one of the arguments that was resolved against the Petitioner here it's not that the agency has that the City has agencies who cater only to one community. It's that some agencies live in a particular community, and so more people will come to it from that community.

If I understood you correctly, you said that it is a compelling state interest to eradicate racial discrimination, but it is not a compelling state interest to eradicate discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. And I was wondering where in this scale that you're using would discrimination on the basis of gender come. Would would that be a compelling state interest? So, for example, if there's an agency that refuses to employ women, would the state have to contract with that agency?

1492,19-123,Elena_Kagan_,2589.81,2606.905," You said excuse me, Mr. Mooppan. You said that the City of Philadelphia could not do the same thing with respect to race.

1493,19-123,Neil_Gorsuch_,2660.815,2692.08," Counsel, can we circle back to the question whether Catholic Social Services should be treated as an employee or agent and whether the City can effectively take over a a service that had been provided privately for for some time, and and taken over so much so that it regulates it pervasively and and this analysis shouldn't apply at all. Can can you address that concern?

Meaning that same-sex couples in Philadelphia simply could not become foster parents, and let's also assume there are no exemptions or other statements that are relevant to the analysis. In that circumstance, would there be any different analysis or result in a case like this?

1496,19-123,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2901.52,2939.615," Good morning. So I'm wondering how we decide whether a law is generally applicable in the in the relevant respect. So you said that the City recognizes a slew of exceptions, but none of them are for the same-sex anti-discrimination requirement. So it's not quite the same thing as granting an exemption, say, for, like, Sunday Sabbath observance but not Saturday Sabbath observance. That's a more apples-to-apples comparison. So how do we go about identifying what the, you know, relevant factor is in deciding whether a law is generally applicable?

Would that be generally applicable then? The same-sex anti-discrimination requirement, I mean.

1498,19-123,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3307.92,3341.805," Well, I suppose you there are certainly different contexts, but the question is at least in certain contexts, you are comfortable with the concept concept of discriminating in this program on the basis of sexual orientation, but you have a very strict rule, you've said there will be no exceptions to CSS's similar taking into account of the sexual orientation status of the would-be parent foster parents.

Mr. Katyal, the you place, obviously, in your briefs and your argument today a lot of reliance on the fact that on your your point that CSS is a contractor. Wouldn't would would your analysis of this case differ if, rather than receiving funds from the City or contracting with the City, CSS was a private organization that was regulated, solely regulated, as opposed to the contractual relationship?

1500,19-123,Clarence_Thomas_,3498.33,3520.235," Could just I I'd like to get one question in before my time expires. Don't you think it's in the best interests of the child to also have a pool that is that is beneficial to the child? I don't understand why that isn't also in the best interests of the child.
",-0.17795240879058838
1501,19-123,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3554.94,3633.625," Yes. What's actually bothering me quite a lot about this case is I think that no family has ever been turned down by this agency. Indeed, none has ever applied, no gay family, no gay couple. And the disagreement seems to be that they now have to sign a piece of paper that says if there were a gay couple, we might have to look into whether they're qualified. And you're willing to have them say, but taking gay into account, you don't have to take it into account at all, but they don't want to do that. Now that seems to me a very narrow ground for deciding a case that has enormous implications. Could you not say, hey, we think if there ever were a gay couple and it really was a problem, you'd have to do something about it, like look into it and don't say gay? And they say: We don't even want to do that, but it's never come up. I mean, the natural thing for me would be to say, okay, you say what you want, we'll say what we want, and if it ever comes up, we'll deal with it. But it never has. Now is there any way that that has anything to do with how we would decide this case?

Page 15. Was that accurate?

1503,19-123,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3767.06,3785.455," Well, the plain meaning of that statement is that if CSS or another religious organization came to the City and said that we do not it is contrary to our religious beliefs to certify a same-sex couple, there would be consideration of an exemption.
",-0.11716879159212112
1504,19-123,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3818.8,3855.005," if that's the City's policy, then the statement that I just read seems to me to be quite misleading, but I'll move on from that. Look, if we if we are honest about what's really going on here, it's not about ensuring that same-sex couples in Philadelphia have the opportunity to be foster parents. It's the fact that the City can't stand the message that Catholic Social Services and the Archdiocese are sending by continuing to adhere to the old-fashioned view about marriage. Isn't that the case?
",1.4210902452468872
1505,19-123,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3888.28,3931.44," Well, as far as the record reflects, no what Catholic Social Services has done has not denied any same-sex couple the opportunity to be foster parents. And because they would refer such a couple, if one were to come to them, to one of the many agencies that is willing to to do what is necessary for them, there's no realistic chance that that is ever going to happen. But the City, nevertheless, is willing to cut them off from participating participation in this program, even if what that means is that there will be foster children in Philadelphia there will be children in Philadelphia who will be denied the opportunity to have foster parents. That's what the record shows, isn't it?

But looking at this under Smith, that pool, what did when you say there's two different pools, one is the pool of can you become an eligible family, and then there's the pool of placing a child. How do you see Smith addressing that?

1508,19-123,Elena_Kagan_,4215.83,4255.355," Mr. Katyal, I'm concerned about Section 3.21 of the contract. So the 2019 version of the contract says and I'm quoting here ""that an agency shall not reject prospective foster or adoptive parents for services based on sexual orientation unless an exception is granted by the Commissioner in his or her sole discretion.""

There seems to be some lack of clarity about which stage we're at here, whether we're at the matching stage or at the screening stage. As as I understand it, this case is about the screening stage, whether Catholic Services would be eligible to participate in a program at all. Is that correct?

1511,19-123,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4489.575,4644.51," Good morning, Mr. Katyal. I have kind of a bigger picture thought to express, and you can react as as you wish. It seems like this case requires us to think about the balance between two very important rights recognized by this Court, the religious exercise and belief right, obviously, in the First Amendment, and the same-sex marriage right, as recognized in Obergefell. And it seems when those rights come into conflict, all levels of government should be careful and should often, where possible and appropriate, look for ways to accommodate both interests in reasonable ways. It's a very you know it's very sensitive, controversial. There are strong very strong feelings on all sides that warrant respect. And it seems like we and governments should be looking, where possible, for win-win answers, recognizing that neither side is going to win completely on these issues given the First Amendment on the one hand and given Obergefell on the other. But, when I look at this case, that's not at all what happened here. It seems like Philadelphia created a clash, it seems, and was looking for a fight and has brought that serious, controversial fight all the way to the Supreme Court even though no same-sex couple had gone to CSS, even though 30 agencies are available for same-sex couples, and even though CSS would refer any same-sex couple to one of those other agencies. And to be clear, I fully appreciate the stigmatic harm. I completely understand that, fully appreciate it. But we need to find a balance that also respects religious beliefs. That was the promise explicitly written by the Court in Obergefell and in Masterpiece, explicitly promised that respect for religious beliefs. And what I fear here is that the absolutist and extreme position that you're articulating would require us to go back on the promise of respect for religious believers.

Is it possible for any entity to participate in the recruitment and certification of foster families without a contract from the City?
",-1.1326154470443726
1513,19-123,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4823.865,4872.56," Well, let's imagine that the state takes over all hospitals and says from now on, you know, we are going to be responsible for hospitals, but we will contract with private entities to actually run them. And so there's a Catholic hospital and gets a contract with the City to run it. In fact, it's a a Catholic hospital that's in existence before the state adopts this policy. And its contract with the state provides that there are in the contract the state gives everyone is that you can get some exceptions for some medical procedures, but every hospital has to perform abortions. In that context, do we analyze this as a licensing question, or, given that the Catholic hospital can't even enter the business without this contract, do you still say that this was the provision of a contractual service?

It doesn't want to expose foster children to that belief in foster parents. And so it terminates CSS's contract because of the church's that church the church's belief in that respect.

I mean, I've always thought that Smith is a problem or a solution to a problem that nobody could figure out how to answer it. If your opponents win, it's pretty hard to see how all kinds of government programs can exist with every religion making exceptions every which way for all kind of reasons, sincerely too. If you win, it's pretty hard to see how, for example, a a religious group that wants to meet on Sunday, the only place to hold services, but there is a there are a no parking sign, and they can't do it. I mean, they can't even hold religious services. And and we could think of lots of examples, like abortion and so forth. And that, I think, is what led Justice Scalia to that more absolute rule.

1522,19-123,Sonia_Sotomayor_,5652.13000005,5705.925," Mr. Fisher, perhaps we should talk about the function, because there is an amicus brief that suggests that in normal contractor cases, the Rutherford brief, that in normal contractor cases, you apply a rationale basis, but where the government has taken over a field, it should be strict scrutiny. And this goes back to Justice Barrett's earlier question about how to define the field. There are still foster parents that private placement with foster parents that CSS can still engage in. The only children that in the in the state's custody are those that have been essentially abandoned or taken away from their parents, correct?

And I talked with Mr. Katyal about 3.21. The solicitor general also references various policies that have to do with placing children, consideration of race and disability at that stage.

One of the challenges of Smith, of course, is asking whether there's an exception, and that raises all sorts of questions about at what level of generality should we look and what's comparable enough.

Would that be I I think it's rather odd that your that the shareholders' dividends can be jeopardized or depleted and that's not a direct claim, but the right to vote on corporate matters is a direct claim.

I think, in reading this, you could, with trying to simplify as much as possible, view the shareholders' claim as saying we bought into this corporation, it was supposed to be private as well as having a public side, and then the government nationalized it. That's what they did. If you look at their giving the net worth to Treasury, it's nationalizing the company. Now whatever conservators do and receivers do, they don't nationalize companies. And when they nationalized this company, naturally, they paid us nothing and our shares became worthless. And so what do you say?

I know you and the shareholders disagree on whether this deal had a reasonable cause, but let's posit a deal that didn't. For no rational base reason, the FHFA sold all of Fannie and Freddie's assets in exchange for one dollar to itself. It did exactly what Justice Breyer said. It nationalized things. It nationalized the company. Your position is that there is no court review of a decision by the FFH as conservator that could give shareholders the right to challenge their action?

Your argument is that the FHFA is unconstitutionally structured given this Court's decision in Seila Law. I see vast differences between the FHFA and the F CFPB. The FHFA's most notable power and the reason we are here today is that they can put certain government-affiliated companies under conservatorship. Conservatorships are are never thought of, in my experience, as an executive power. It's historically been an adjunct to the judicial power. So why isn't that and and this is not a wide-reaching power that affects many entities. It's one company at a time essentially, unlike in the CFPB. So why can't we say that this is an exception to Humphrey's Estate or Morrison versus Olson?

If if I understood you right, you said that the only final action that's being challenged here is the Third Amendment. So I'm going to repeat his question to you because I I wasn't quite sure I got your answer. If that's the case, that that's the only final action challenged here, what basis would we have to do anything more than issue a a a declaratory judgment about the validity of that amendment?

The plaintiffs here have sought declaratory judgment in aid of further remedies retro- retroactive remedies that might actually do them some good, and and and that's the Third Amendment. And I guess I'm a little confused why we wouldn't proceed to hold that the Third Amendment was void from the beginning by virtue of the appointments clause problem. It's pretty much what we did in Lucia, as you'll recall, where where we vacated the the ALJ's decision. Why wouldn't we do the same here?

Isn't that a degree of speculation that is quite beyond us?

1548,19-422,Neil_Gorsuch_,1432.2,1469.915," I I understand that point, but Congress decided to put this person separate from the political process for a reason, and it might have been to insulate them all from the blowback that might come. Who knows? I don't know, you don't know, none of us knows. Isn't that isn't that the whole point? And and what do we do again, just to return to my fundamental question, is why isn't this void? When when we have the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, for example, it says that an action taken by somebody who's without power is void, not just voidable, not ratifiable, it is void.

1550,19-422,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1673.235,1690.655," Well, those are good points, and I guess the one point that's in tension with that is that Congress also designated it an independent agency, and if the official, even though acting, running it is removable at will, the agency's no longer independent.

He had the there was no constitutional problem with it. Let's say that we also agree with you that there was a problem with the confirmed director because he was removable only for cause. So the confirmed director was administering the Third Amendment, administering the conservatorship, and passing along all the earnings from the GSEs into the Treasury. Would that create a structural problem because even though perhaps the Third Amendment at its inception was valid, could the administering of the Third Amendment by an unconstitutional executive official contaminate it with structural errors such that the whole Third Amendment would have to be set aside?

Because, you know, Treasury viewed it as winding down the GSEs, winding down their assets, although, you know, it's been characterized not as a receivership but as a conservatorship. Could the confirmed director have said, okay, listen, now this is no longer serving to make the GSEs solvent, and so it's time to shift arrangements? Did the confirmed director have that authority under the Third Amendment.

I'm having a hard time understanding why the corporate law distinction matters in this APA claim, why we can import those concepts from corporate law into the APA, because it seems to me that the shareholders have Article III standing. They've suffered a pocketbook injury. You haven't contended, I don't think, that they're not within the zone of interest of the statute. And the APA gives a direct cause of action for someone aggrieved by agency action. So why do we even care about the direct/derivative distinction?

Say I agree with you that the acting director is constitutional because removable at will and he enters into the Third Amendment, but the Third Amendment provides for payments in an ongoing way and including payments under a a a regular director who is is not constitutionally appointed.

That would be action by the regular director and, certainly, it would seem to me could be challengeable under the given that unconstitutionality.

But it seems to be that you're trying to say that we should not be looking at the agency qua agency as an executive agency, but we should see whether the power that they're wielding in individual situations is executive or not. Am I getting your argument correct?

1560,19-422,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2657.92,2683.81," All right. So, if it's an executive agency, then I think we do have to look at the constitutionality of its structure, and and if we have to do that, how do we get to a subdivision of whether an individual act it did was executive or not? Difficulty separating the concepts.

So, if the shareholders if the shareholders have argued that the director's for cause removal is a structural error, that has to do with Justice Alito's question and Justice Gorsuch's earlier questioning of the government. If they're correct, do we have discretion against enjoining the Third Act? How do we get from a structural error to a harmless error? What do we consider to do that? In which situations are we permitted to do that?

I mean, there's there's not much that those two opinions agreed on, but this seems to be one of them, that, you know, the FHFA makes rules, it conducts enforcement actions, it has subpoena power.

1564,19-422,Neil_Gorsuch_,2917.64,3034.75," Good morning, Mr. Nielson. A a lot of your remedial argument seems to hinge on the happenstance that we had an acting director at the time of the Third Amendment's adoption. I I'd like to highlight two potential difficulties with that and ask for your thoughts. The first is the assumption that the acting director is answerable to the President while the director is not. Under the statute creating this outfit, the director appoints deputy directors, the director, not the President. It appears that those deputy directors would be insulated from the President therefore. And when when the director steps aside, he names the acting director, or, rather, he gives a pool of three of his deputies and the President chooses which of those three. But the director appointed all three of them. So I'm not sure in what sense or where we get the inference or how we generate from some penumbra emanating somewhere that the President has the removal power over this acting director. That's one. And two is, let's let's box in that, let's assume that's the case. So what? The the plaintiffs here challenged actions after during this whole period, including after a period in which the acting director disappeared and we now have a director. You say, well, that that that doesn't matter because the amendment is a thing that was adopted by the acting director. But the plaintiffs are challenging the director's actions as void because he is unanswerable to the President. So why wouldn't we at least be able to provide relief voiding the director's actions once we had a a a Senate-confirmed director in 2014?
",0.1190158799290657
1565,19-422,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3160.44,3202.285," In your opening, you mentioned a a slippery slope argument that if this agency structure was unconstitutional, then so too would be the Social Security Administration, the Office of Special Counsel, which are also headed by single directors, and I think the Solicitor General agrees on that. But then you went on to name multi-member agencies in the federal and civil service. And my understanding of the principle that would be applicable here would be that single director independent agencies are not historically rooted, as the Court said in Seila Law, and that's all we would be saying and applying here.
",0.13799944519996643
1566,19-422,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3267.7,3304.69," So, Mr. Nielson, I would have come away from Seila Law thinking that there were two exceptions to this rule, Humphrey's Executor and Morrison versus Olson. But it seems to me and this goes back to some of the questions that Justices Sotomayor and Kagan were pressing you on it seems to me that you're kind of arguing for a third ground here, which is, well, then we take a look at what is the executive official really doing. Does this really seem like a lot of executive power or a little executive power, something that looks more like private power? It strikes me as a pretty hard test to administer. So could you say a little bit more about that?

But I checked this morning, and Fannie Mae was trading at $2.69 and Freddie Mac at $2.56, and your shares are not worthless. They're worth something, presumably, largely based on judgments about what the future holds. So doesn't that run render your sort of nationalization rhetoric just that, rhetoric?

Now it may be a gamble on the future, but that's that has value in itself.

And the director says, I agree, and I will conduct myself on that understanding, and, in fact, I will verify every single morning that you still want me in office and you don't, as a matter of whim, want me to leave.

It does seem counterintuitive, perhaps illogical, to say that assuming you're right that the FHFA director must be removable at will, why you should get anything more than a gen than a declaratory judgment to that effect. First, the argument is that this decision was entered into by two entities under the complete control of the President. There is no dispute that the Treasury had treasurer is removable at will. So we know what the President would have wanted because he had an agency he fully and unequivocally controlled entering this agreement. And then, secondly, we have an acting director, which almost logically means that he could be removable entering it. Second, no President has ever tried to remove the director, acting or otherwise. So, given those circumstances, I am not sure why structural how this agreement or even the at will how the at will termination affected you.

1580,19-422,Elena_Kagan_,4807.05999995,4856.78," Mr. Thompson, I I just go back to Justice Alito's question about the Social Security Administration. I'll put some scary sounding numbers on this. The SSA has been led by a single commissioner since 1994 and ever since then, it's rendered 650,000 decisions every year, so that's about 17 million decisions. Now you told Justice Alito, well, maybe there are some exceptions for lower-level employees. I'm not sure that ALJs would qualify as that, and even if they do, let's assume, which I think is probably true, that all of those decisions are rendered pursuant to guidance and rules that the SSA commissioner has enforced. So are we really going to void all of those decisions?

1581,19-422,Elena_Kagan_,4920.415,4941.92," No, I I mean, I think Lucia is a different question. It's an appointments clause question. We can come back to that. But, I mean, are you really making a good faith argument that if there were at if there were for cause excuse me, if there were at will removal of the Social Security Administration that these 17 million decisions would come out differently or, indeed, that any of them would?

Why why isn't that the right question?

1583,19-422,Elena_Kagan_,5020.84,5034.515," Does that mean, Mr. Thompson, that we have to do a great deal more than invalidate the the the Third Amendment and everything that follows from it? I mean, why shouldn't we go back to the the the the the First or the Second?

1584,19-422,Neil_Gorsuch_,5063.59500005,5118.49," Counsel, your remedial ask is a big one and and hard hard for us to swallow, I know. And and I I I I I want to I want to focus on a couple aspects of it that that we we've that are particularly important. The the first is that once we had a new director in 2014, we we've heard a suggestion that that you haven't complained about actions taken after 2014 in your complaint, and the only complaint has to do with the entry into the Third Amend Amendment, which took place during the pendency of a prior director. I'd like your I'd like to understand your thoughts about that first. And, second, whether a new constitutionally correct director that we ordain today could ratify the actions of an unconstitutional arrangement previously. Why would it have to be void?
",0.04824107512831688
1585,19-422,Neil_Gorsuch_,5217.97,5236.995," And I guess I'm asking why not. I mean, I understand, like, the Federal Vacancy Reform Act says that can't be done when its terms apply, and but why why couldn't we as some sort of equitable, remedial dodge do that here?
",0.0411461666226387
1586,19-422,Neil_Gorsuch_,5256.485,5274.76500005," It it's fine. If you if you have any further thoughts about why it couldn't be ratified, I'd welcome them, but let me just pose you one last question, and that is the argument that, of course, the President could have fired the acting director because the Vacancy Act would normally apply and that would permit him to do so.
",-0.3057461977005005
1587,19-422,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,5333.815,5395.865," Thank you. And good morning, Mr. Thompson. Picking up on the first part of Justice Gorsuch's questions, the Solicitor General, in the the reply brief on the remedies question, starts with Marbury and says since Marbury, this Court has continued to subject structural constitutional claims to the general law of remedies and said courts may deny relief on such claims as a result of estoppel, de facto officer doctrine, ratification, failure to make a timely objection, or the grant of a stay, and then says that you have cited other cases where the Court has vacated actions taken by unconstitutionally structured agencies. But the Solicitor General says those cases show only that vacatur is permissible in an appropriate case, not that it is mandatory in every case and that those principles I've just mentioned can apply. Your response to that?
",-0.8149117231369019
1588,19-422,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,5434.84,5473.505," And then switching gears on the some of the arguments made by the amicus, the forceful arguments made in distinguishing Seila Law and other precedents, I want to get your reaction to a couple of those. The amicus points out that Seila Law used the phrase ""significant executive power."" Your response to that? Was that a descriptor, descriptive language, or or is that a necessary condition before we can say that a for-cause removal restriction on an executive officer is unconstitutional? The amicus says the latter.
",-0.8324750065803528
1589,19-422,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,5524.725,5556.745," And then the amicus says, on on a different front, that the implications for other agencies could be significant and that the Court could not limit its holding here to single-director independent agencies and leave those for another day, whether those follow or not would still be an open issue. Do you what's your reaction to amicus's point that this would necessarily carry over into multi-member agencies, at least with chair designations and things like that?
",-0.8107320666313171
1590,19-422,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5571.67,5614.465," Mr. Thompson, I want to just make sure I understand the thrust of your argument for structural error. Let's assume that we think that the acting director was removable at will, there was no constitutional problem with the acting director. And let's further imagine that the acting director is the one who was in charge for say, you know, up until six months ago, up until last year, and then we had a confirmed director. Does that mean that everything that happened in the course of the Third Amendment is then void as structurally invalid because, at some point, a constitutionally invalid officer entered the scene?

1591,19-422,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5642.58,5677.04," No, no, no, no. I understand that. I'm just trying to figure out how much participation by the unconstitutional officer matters, I mean, because, here, we didn't have constant, 100 percent of the time, control by a confirmed director. But you're arguing, I mean, and and I'm saying let's assume that we think the acting director posed no problem, if the Third Amendment was entered into by the acting director with no constitutional problem, you're still saying that the participation of the confirmed director was a structural error that invalidated the Third Amendment and everything with it, correct?

1593,19-422,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,6030.03999995,6046.915," Thank you, counsel. Mr. Nielson, this Court appointed you to brief and argue the case as an amicus curiae in support of the position that the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Agency does not violate the separation of powers. You have ably discharged that responsibility, for which we are grateful. The case is submitted.

1594,20-255,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,130.535,168.125," Counsel, you said that the schools can't regulate political or religious speech but but also that the schools can regulate speech from off campus that is directed at the school. So what do you do with political or religious speech that is directed at the school? You know, a sign a student is carrying around off campus that says don't approve the school bond funding referendum. Where how do you balance the the one situation against the other?
",-1.1283551454544067
1595,20-255,Clarence_Thomas_,277.17,310.385," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Ms. Blatt, how how do you separate that? What if a student said some of those same things that the Chief Justice posited but in a social studies class? How would you separate that from then from just participating in class or as opposed to doing the exact same thing or saying the exact same thing off campus?
",-1.653092622756958
1596,20-255,Clarence_Thomas_,352.71,388," So you did say you mentioned context, and you said that, well, the sleepover is different from school, or you suggested that. And then you did mention social media. But aren't we at a point where, if it's on social media, where you post it on social media doesn't really matter? You could do it in class, algebra class, or you could do it at a sleepover and say the exact same thing about Ms. Johnson. It's so how would that make any difference, where you post it?
",0.2504873275756836
1597,20-255,Clarence_Thomas_,414.43,443.75," So why does it have to be about the school? Can't there be comments about other hot-button issues or about current controversies, like protests or Black Lives Matter, Antifa, or Proud Boys or something like that, people can take sides that are just as disruptive in the school setting as comments about Ms. Johnson?
",0.36909133195877075
1598,20-255,Stephen_G_Breyer_,507.34,609.65," Good morning. I I read Tinker, and Tinker seems to say that in the context of a student protest in school at least, school, you cannot punish this unless there is material and substantial disruption or you invade the rights of other students. You cannot. It doesn't say if it does those things you can punish it. It says you can't unless. And the issue here seems, does that apply off campus? Why not? After all, if I look at the case here in the record, is there in the record something that shows that what this young woman did I mean, she used swear words, you know, unattractive swear words, off campus. Did that cause a material and substantial disruption? I don't see much evidence it did. And if swearing off campus did, I mean, my goodness, every school in the country would be doing nothing but punishing. And it certainly didn't help others I mean disrupt others. It didn't hurt others as far as I'm aware, as far as I can see in the record. So why isn't that the case? I mean, sure, if you exceed Tinker unless you meet Tinker, you can't punish it, at least in the context of protests, and, here, pretty clearly, it didn't satisfy what Tinker says is necessary to satisfy.
",1.0871870517730713
1599,20-255,Stephen_G_Breyer_,625.52,645.22," All right. You want to review the Third Circuit. That's what's mystifying me. The Third Circuit says Tinker doesn't apply. If Tinker doesn't apply, they can punish more, not less, because Tinker puts some limits on what you can punish in school. You'd think a fortiori outside of school.
",0.8857401013374329
1600,20-255,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,712.54,784.39," Ms. Blatt, I understand you to say that schools cannot discipline a student for things that the student says outside the school, not in connection with a school program, about subjects such as politics, religion, morality, economics, et cetera, et cetera. The problem is when the student says something that implicates those subjects but links it in some way to a student or a teacher. And what you say is and the Solicitor General makes a similar argument it matters whether the speech targets the school. I have no idea what it means to target the school. Now let me give you an example to make this more concrete, and since Tinker occurred back during the Vietnam War, it it it will relate to that. So, during the war, a student says, war is immoral, American soldiers are baby killers, I hope there are a lot of casualties so that people will rise up. Even if that would cause a disruption in the school, I understand you to say the school couldn't do anything about it. Is that right?
",0.9236171841621399
1601,20-255,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,831.69,859.16," that that is where I I think there is a problem because, when you tell me that it's or you or one of the other very able attorneys says it's context-specific, it depends on the facts of a particular case, there are a lot of things you have to consider, I'm really worried about how that is going to be implemented. I think, if we're going to if schools are going to have any authority under Tinker outside of school, there has to be a clear rule. That's what I'm looking for.
",0.7977020144462585
1602,20-255,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,888.235,924.38," Well, I I just don't understand what that means in concrete terms. I'll give you another example. My time is is basically up. A student believes that someone who is biologically male is a male, and there is a student who is biologically male but identifies as a woman, has adopted a female name, but the student who has the objection refers to this person by the person's prior male name and uses male pronouns. Can the school do something about that?

1603,20-255,Sonia_Sotomayor_,964.25,984.25," Ms. Blatt, the problem that I have with Tinker is that I'm not sure it's any clearer a rule than any of the others that you're criticizing. Let me start with just this case. Can you punish the student for cursing at home --
",0.19999617338180542
1604,20-255,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1000.985,1021.04," All right. Now, if you can't punish them for doing that, you're punishing her here because she went on the Internet and cursed and used a curse word related to what? To her unhappiness with the school and cheering, right?
",0.4773404002189636
1605,20-255,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1027.46,1082.605," we could quibble with that, but my point is, I'm told by my law clerks, that among certain populations a certain large percentage of the population, how much you curse is a badge of honor. That would surprise many parents. However, if it is true, where do we draw the line with respect to it targeting a school? Kids basically talk to their classmates. Most of their conversation is about school. Most of their exchanges have to do with their perceptions of the authoritarian nature of their teachers and others. And why isn't this any different than just that the coach of this team took personal offense?
",1.168270468711853
1606,20-255,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1084.1,1115.15," She spent she spent a few minutes talking to students, reporting this incident. How is that a substantial disruption, number one? And how is this, the nature of the speech, such that it intends to provoke disrespect when she put it to a page that was supposed to disappear and it was only a classmate taking a snapshot who showed it to anybody?
",-0.5307405591011047
1607,20-255,Elena_Kagan_,1190.31,1236.425," Ms. Blatt, it seems to me that your argument that Tinker is the entire analysis may depend on a on a version of Tinker that the lower courts really have not adopted, because you say that there can't be any regulation of political or reg or regulation of religious speech. But I'll just give you two cases, one where there was a ban on shirts saying ""We are not criminals"" to protest an immigration bill, another a shirt saying ""Homosexuality is a sin."" And in both cases, the Court said Tinker allows the school to say that you shouldn't wear those kinds of things to school. Do you think that's clearly wrong?
",0.6284761428833008
1608,20-255,Elena_Kagan_,1261.19,1300.905," that's what I'm asking about, Ms. Blatt, because I would have thought I mean, maybe I I did get that holding wrong, but I would have thought where students say, we're going to come in with the Confederate flag or we're going to come in with, you know, Black Lives Matter or homosexuality is a sin or gay pride in ways that the school thinks is going to cause disruption, that the school can ban those if the school is right about that, that, you know, where where where those symbols or or speech will cause severe disruption, that the school can say: No, you can't bring your Confederate flag to school tomorrow.
",1.2397609949111938
1609,20-255,Elena_Kagan_,1335.52,1357.77500005," So you're saying, Ms. Blatt, that what we should do in this case is just make courts clear you know, tell courts: Look, Tinker is it. It's it on campus; it's it off campus. But, in applying Tinker, you have to allow religious and political speech no matter how disruptive the school it it will be in the school?
",0.03361845016479492
1610,20-255,Neil_Gorsuch_,1426.365,1451.755," Yeah. I I I'd like to pick up where Justice Kagan left off. I I I I'm confused. You started off this presentation by saying political and religious speech are absolutely protected, but I think, in in response to both the Chief Justice and Justice Kagan, you suggested that there may be limits there as well. Can you explain what your your test is?
",-0.3158593773841858
1611,20-255,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1575.91,1685.175," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Ms. Blatt. I want to focus on the facts of this case a bit and and my reaction to it. As you say and I think helpful for you, the context here is a team and a coach, not the school more generally. But, as a judge and maybe as a coach and a parent too, it seems like maybe a bit of over overreaction by the coach. So my reaction when I read this, she's competitive, she cares, she blew off steam like millions of other kids have when they're disappointed about being cut from the high school team or not being in the starting lineup or not making all league. And just by way of comparison about and to show how much it means to people, you know, arguably, the greatest basketball player of all time is inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2009 and gives a speech, and what does he talk about? He talks about getting cut as a sophomore from the varsity team. And he wasn't joking. He was critical 30 years later. It still it still bothered him. And I think that's just emblematic of how much it means to kids to make a high school team. It is so important to their lives, and coaches sweat the cuts, and it guts coaches to have to cut a kid who's on the bubble, and and good coaches understand the importance and they understand the emotions. So maybe what bothers me when I read all this is that it didn't seem like the punishment was tailored to the offense given what I just said about how important it is and you know how much it means to the kids. I mean, a year's suspension from the team just seems excessive to me. But how does that fit into the First Amendment doctrine or does it fit in at all in a case like this?
",1.3372539281845093
1612,20-255,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1729.8,1744.285," But, in the moment in the moment, you know that kid's going to be upset, and and you you know, you you you recognize that. I'm not saying this is justified necessarily. I'm not. But but a year seems like a lot.
",1.3636281490325928
1613,20-255,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1751.51,1768.55," So the so the do on the legal issue, the do no harm, I I think legally speaking, you know, we should try to do no harm here, your your approach would be to just say the Tinker standard applies regardless of the price precise location of the speech and just remand? Is that enough?
",-0.49445614218711853
1614,20-255,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1772.965,1834.49," Good morning, Ms. Blatt. So let me let let's assume that I think about the case in the following way, you know, that high school students enjoy the same free speech rights as everyone else. Tinker acknowledged that in the context of the once you cross the schoolhouse gate, those rights are somewhat reduced because of the school environment and the need to, you know, control and avoid substantial disruption, but they're not lost altogether, but that nothing in Tinker suggests itself that it applies outside of the school environment. And so what you're asking us to do is to extend the school's authority that Tinker acknowledges outside of the school environment. And I think you have good policy reasons for doing that. You know, I think harassment, bullying, and I think threats of violence against the school and cheating are all things that would be of concern. I don't see a lot of doctrinal support for saying that Tinker applies, you know, that that the schools' increased authority applies. Tell me what you think doctrinally your best authority is.
",0.8723779320716858
1615,20-255,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1877.9,1961.065," Well, but I think, actually, Ms. Blatt, that's part of the problem, because, you know, you point out that the other side's test, or proposed test, has its problems at the edges because of the Internet and remote learning and all of that. But your three-part test certainly has its own issues. You know, it's not going to be easy to apply, and I think a lot of the questions that you've gotten today show a concern, including in this case, that schools abuse this authority and that they punish things that maybe don't cause substantial disruption or political speech or religious speech that they shouldn't or you know, I think you've heard a lot of skepticism about whether the speech at issue in this case actually caused substantial disruption. So I I I I guess my concern is, if we have two two tests being offered or on offer, neither one is going to be easy to apply in all cases, they'll both have hard cases, which one ought we apply? Which one is the more protective of speech? And and let me ask you this: Insofar as the policy concerns go, nothing in the First Amendment prohibits soft discipline, right, like, in this case, the cheerleader coming to school and being told rather than being kicked off the team and punished, being told we're aware of the Snapchat, this is not good for team cohesion, this is not respectful of your coaches, if we see any of this kind of behavior on the field or at practice or undermining morale, there is going to be a consequence but not imposing one yet. That would be okay, right?
",0.9575431942939758
1616,20-255,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2079.505,2104.505," Mr. Stewart, if you get to the point of considering whether speech is directed at a school, I I wonder how you parse that because, you know, teenagers, maybe most of their friends are also their their classmates. And does that mean that anything that they generally send out directed at their friends has to be considered that it's directed at the school?
",-0.8820813298225403
1617,20-255,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2131.33,2149.535," What about speech political speech that involves the school, you know, opposing a school referendum because Ms. Jones is a terrible teacher? Does do you categorize that as political speech, which is off limits, or speech directed at the school, which can be regulated?

1618,20-255,Clarence_Thomas_,2204.055,2229.51," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Stewart, should we analyze a the rules of a team, as Justice Kavanaugh alluded to, as opposed to the general rules that apply to the school population? Is there a difference in how we should treat team members versus just students?
",-1.5612354278564453
1619,20-255,Clarence_Thomas_,2296.57,2333.225," Well, let me let me ask let me squeeze in one other question real quick. The when we talk about material disruption as a basis for preventing or disciplining students who engage in certain speeches or conduct, can you also localize that to the team so that if a team member disrupts the team, that it's okay to discipline that team member, even though you wouldn't normally do it, discipline that person as a member of the student body?
",-0.6409764885902405
1620,20-255,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2365.41,2430.165," As far as I can see, I can't write a treatise on the First Amendment in this case, and so, at the moment, I'm thinking there are only two ways of dealing with it. One, treat it as an example. We can't go beyond that. Look at the record and then decide. Or the other is everyone seems to want some rule, and the rule, I think, might be take Tinker as if it said, which it doesn't, as if it said: School, you do have some authority where there's a substantial injury to disruption in the class or somebody's going to be hurt in that school, et cetera. And I would add: But, remember, it's outside the school. And that's primarily the domain of the parents. And even when it's inside the school, you're not a schoolmaster. Judge, be careful. Okay? I can say something like that. Well, what should I do?
",0.9304832816123962
1621,20-255,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2518.965,2549.525," Suppose a student says something outside of school that relates to an important subject, like politics, religion, morality, et cetera, et cetera, makes no reference to the school or to a teacher or a student, but the remarks are so offensive that they will predictably cause controversy within the school and could distract the students from the educational process. Does the school have any authority to discipline the student?
",0.3628682494163513
1622,20-255,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2576.55,2601.965," All right. So an important part of the test that you propose is whether the speech intentionally targets specific individuals or groups in the school community. The verb ""target"" means select as an object of attention or attack. So does school target an individual, a student or a teacher, whenever it refers to the teacher or student?
",-1.3608248233795166
1623,20-255,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2626.68,2642.945," Well, what troubles me is that that what you just proposed is a a very nebulous line, and I'm quite concerned about the effect of this on on freedom of speech. I think we need clear lines. Can you clarify can you give me anything firmer than what you just said?

1624,20-255,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2675.65,2747.385," Mr. Stewart, your test speaks about I'm not sure, and I I'm following Justice Thomas's questioning seems to focus on sports teams, but one could say that about any extracurricular activity, that there is team spirit of some sort involved in science lab work, in after-school science lab work, in forensic speech-writing or arguing. There isn't an after-school activity where the spirit of that activity couldn't be perceived as being impacted by what people find is unpopular. So let's get to a Black Lives Matter T-shirt.

I strongly share Justice Breyer's instinct when he mentioned that we probably can't write a treatise here and shouldn't write a treatise here and can't foresee all the things that could arise in a lot of the hypotheticals that have been raised. So I just want to get your reaction if we just simply said the First Amendment does not categorically prohibit public schools from disciplining students for speech that occurs off campus, period. It may matter that the analysis here involves or the situation here involves a team, not just the school more broadly, period. Remand. Is that enough?

Mr. Cole, you a number of times have said you mentioned that the location of the conduct or the speech at school, under the school's supervision, et cetera. Isn't that complicated by the Internet and by social media? And you could send the exact same messages that could cause problems from your local 7-11 or you could send it to classmates who happen to be in class. You could send it over the weekend, but it still has a permanence that would certainly allow it to be used in class.

Is there any difference between the regulation of athletes or participants in after-school programs, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, is there any difference between that organization, after-school organization or activity regulating a student's conduct versus the school regulating the overall student body population?

Why wouldn't would you allow under your formulation a school to take preemptive steps to prevent disruption, or does a school have to wait await disruption before it can respond?

1636,20-255,Stephen_G_Breyer_,4208.89,4319.56," Thank you. The difficulty I have I've already mentioned. A few years ago, a superintendent of schools, I think in San Francisco, said, you know, schools have changed a lot, the public schools, since when I went there. He said, today we don't just teach classical subjects. We're there to help the child have adequate health, in many cases, to see that he's adequately fed. In quite a few cases, we become a caretaker, and we don't want to send them home immediately because there's nobody home, and we have to plan after-school activities. There are dozens of areas that didn't used to be thought of as within the purview of the public school. Today, in many places, they are. Now add to that the Internet and the Internet not just listening to teachers but also doing homework and also writing papers, sometimes vaguely defined and sometimes and sometimes. Well, how do I get a standard out of that? I'm frightened to death of writing a standard. And Tinker, after all, doesn't really write a standard. It just says you can't regulate school unless it substantially disrupts or hurts somebody else. It doesn't say if it does that you can do anything you want. You still must use some kind of test, like proportionality or something else, and I can mention that often outside of school it's the parents' job, not the teachers' if, by the way, there are parents in the house, et cetera, and I can mention the differences and say take those into account. But I do not see how to go beyond that, and any suggestions you have will be welcome.

1637,20-255,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4438.63,4536.155," Mr. Cole, there is a huge gap between the broad and very important free speech issues that have been briefed and discussed this morning and the particular incident involved in this case. If we're going to address the broad issues, then I, for one, think we need clear rules that protect freedom of speech. On the other hand, if the Court, having decided to take this case, wants to decide it without addressing those broad issues, of course, the Court could dismiss the case, and I assume you wouldn't have an objection to that. But, if the Court doesn't do that, could the Court do something along these lines: Say Tinker applies in school. It says nothing one way or the other about what a school may or may not do to student speech outside the school. We look at the particular comments made here. They're made in colorful language, but, substantively, they boil down to something like, I have no respect for the school, I have no respect for the cheer squad, I hate the school, I hate the cheer squad, I also hate my private softball team. A school can't discipline a student for off-campus speech that does no more than say, I hate the school, I have no respect for the school?

So is there anything that a school can do about that? You say, I guess, that they have the school has no more authority in this area than other government officials.

1639,20-255,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4765.87,4860.345," Mr. Cole, the problem with your line-drawing is we have traditional categories: fighting words, obscenity, true threats. We even have definitions of what constitutes sexual harassment. The level at which speech has to arrive to meet those standards is very, very high, and I'm dubious that most of the conduct that teenagers engage in would fit any of our traditional categories. So let's talk about harassment, okay? A common episode, I think I read it in a newspaper, a young girl is subjected to each time she goes out of the house, whether she's in the playground, not the school playground, or walking to school with a group of classmates walking by and saying, you're so ugly, why are you even alive? That's not a true threat. They're not threatening her with any bodily harm. It is not harassment if that's all if they're just speaking. So and they're not interfering with her movement to or from school. Why that would be the kind of situation that I don't see a First Amendment category fitting. So, under your theory of this case, would the school be powerless?

There's a lot of conduct that comes to the edge. You're now asking schools to determine what is constitutional in terms of misbehavior by students that they can attempt to control or not control?

But it's it's also possible to understand Tinker as a decision about what's necessary for a school's learning environment. And it might be that student speech that occurs outside of school is sometimes going to cause fundamental problems, disruption of the school's learning environment, and I guess then the question is why we shouldn't acknowledge that and allow a school to deal with it.

1644,20-255,Elena_Kagan_,5217.19,5271.44," I mean I mean, those are some easy cases, but you've also been asked about bullying cases, harassment cases, and and you've tended to say, well, sure, don't don't worry, you can deal with that because there may be constitutional codes that are anti-bullying or anti-harassment. And and there may indeed. But I think we have a general sense that schools have more latitude over this kind of speech than than other government officials, so I'll just give you one example. Suppose that there are boys in a school who have a website and and and rank all the girls in the school on on matters of appearance and and and such things, or maybe talk about their sexual activities. And we wouldn't put people in jail for that, you know, outside of a school context, but it seems as though a school should be able to deal with it. Why not?

I'm I'm struggling to understand the delta or difference between your test and the Petitioner's at the end of the day with respect to off-campus speech that results in a person on campus being denied an educational opportunity, which is what what I understood your test for for off off off-campus bullying to be. What what is the difference between that and and a substantial disruption on-campus test?

As I mentioned to Ms. Blatt, I think that's entirely typical and widespread for decades and decades when when kids are disappointed by something like that. And then the coach's reaction, you know, it seems like an excessive sanction, but we're not there, we don't know all the circumstances and don't want to second-guess that too much. But I guess I'll start where Justice Gorsuch was discussing with you. It just seems entirely different to be talking about a team and not a school, and I'm just not sure and I'm going to ask follow-up questions about this. I'm really trying to figure out the practical difference for courts in the wake of this case between if we adopt your test and Ms. Blatt's test. So, team, and then move on to that if you can.

I think you can answer the question presented here very clearly without writing a treatise, and that that's the point I was trying to make. And the question presented is just whether Tinker applies off campus. We can answer that yes or no. If we answer it yes, obviously, that will answer the question presented. If we answer it no, here's the the point for you: You still have all these exceptions that allow, as I understand it, the First Amendment that mean that the First Amendment does not categorically prohibit public schools from disappointing students for speech that occurs off campus. So I think that's the point that Justice Gorsuch was making. You just do it differently than Ms. Blatt. She says Tinker applies off campus. You say Tinker doesn't apply off campus, but, by the way, the First Amendment still allows the schools to regulate speech that occurs off campus in a number of circumstances. I'm just wondering whether that's worth the candle.

Let's talk about the harassment example that you were discussing with Justice Sotomayor. Tinker doesn't apply off campus, let's say, you know, that we're in that world, and you say that the school could, much like a city official, if I'm understanding this correctly, prohibit harassment that rises to the level of interference with another student's educational opportunities, and I assume that would be judged if the if the school adopted would you envision that in a bullying statute or would you envision that in a school-adopted policy? Let's start with that.
",-0.0385606624186039
1654,20-255,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,6200.7,6236.12," Okay. So let me ask you about the test. So the policy from comes from the school. So the school adopts a policy, say, about bullying, and then it gets challenged when a student is disciplined for off-campus bullying. Let's imagine Justice Sotomayor's example of the, you know, you're so ugly, you're so ugly, and it it rises to the level where the the child just can't go to school anymore, or the example about the disabled student who is taunted with sexually graphic images on his way home from school. That's subject to a First Amendment challenge, and what you're saying, well, there's a compelling state interest, but it's narrowly tailored. Is is that what you're envisioning, content discrimination but --

1655,20-255,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,6380.435,6415.455," Okay. What would be wrong with a test like this? One of your problems is that it's difficult to define the school environment and what constitutes the school environment. What would be wrong with saying that the school environment exists when the student is relating not just supervisory. I mean, that that's narrow. What about when the student is relating to the school in the student's capacity as a student? So, if the student is directly communicating with the school, sending e-mails to the school, sending e-mails to a teacher at the teacher's school e-mail account, would those be within the school environment on your definition?

1656,20-255,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,6526.74,6691.865," Thank you, counsel. Rebuttal, Ms. Blatt. MS. BLATT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. There's some sort of twilight zone going on when the head of the ACLU says that schools allow hecklers' veto, punishment for whistleblowing, any kind of reporting, any kind of criticism, all that matters is someone is offended. And you have the Biden administration and the school district saying that's not true. That's not what Tinker allows. Now Mr. Cole said the case law allows us to act like Soviets and the North North Koreans. But the since the Saxe opinion, the Morse concurrence, Fillmore, and Zamecnik have left clean clear lines for schools in that hecklers' vetoes are not allowed. And your choice is this: If you you could choose to either tighten Tinker or you can say, well, we're going to assume Tinker is out of control on campus, but we will leave open season on schools and complete chaos as to what their test allows. Under their view, all 50 states define bullying in terms of Tinker. You have the same e-mail chain that would toggle on and off campus and you would have the Tinker test applying when there's some on-campus speech, and I don't know what applies. I think Mr. Cole said it's the Tinker test, but he's afraid to use the Tinker word because it's scary, and it shouldn't be. You're much better off cleaning this doctrine up. Justice Kagan, you had amazing questions about school speech. Remember, our test is the audience has to be the school, so all of your speech, if it's to the press, the police, your pastor, your family, et cetera, none of that is school speech even if it involves a school topic. Justice Barrett, on threats, the facts in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Bell, nobody knew whether that was a threat. The police were sort of involved. It is not fair to the parents of those other kids to have schools fumbling around. Well, I don't know what this applies before we had Tinker, part of the threats were on campus, part were off, it was on the Internet. Let's look at where she drafted it, maybe she was to and from. Now let's move to the school supervision: madness, confusion, and chaos. Please don't do this to schools. Mr. Cole said you could prevent swearing to and from school. That's nuts. You're in the dad's minivan. That's school supervision under their view. No one thinks Fraser applies there, and yet all of a sudden, when you get out of the minivan and I guess walking to it, but maybe it depends on how far you park, Tinker is going in and out of coverage, that rule makes no sense. There's no case law on conduct that aids and abets school speech. You will have a school speech petition. You can keep denying cert, but I guarantee the courts are going to they're going to freak out when Tinker has been the law off campus for 20 years. Thank you.

The there's no definition of a notice of appeal or a notice to appear, I'm sorry. The definition is written notice. And it says, parenthetically, in this section referred to as ""a notice of appeal"" of appeal ""notice to appear."" So and you seem to put quite a bit of of weight on ""a notice to appear.""

1668,19-863,Neil_Gorsuch_,1214.49,1240," It sure seems a little bit like Pereira groundhog day to me. I guess I'm curious what your argument what your response is to the government's argument that it should just win under Chevron step 2 at a minimum. No harm, no foul. Good enough for government work. If it's ambiguous, the tie goes to the government. Why why why why should we why should we care?

1669,19-863,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1392.275,1415.53," Thank you. And good morning, Mr. Zimmer. I want to pick up on what Justice Thomas was saying. The statute requires written notice, and, as I understand it, your client did receive written notice of everything in Section 1229(a). So why doesn't that end the case?
",-0.8111821413040161
1670,19-863,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1472.025,1507.17," you're you're relying, obviously, on a notice to appear and the parenthetical, which does not, as Justice Thomas said, necessarily account for the term ""written notice"" in the text. I take your point about the context and the history. But, also, the the problem, I think, that the Chief Justice and Justice Alito and Justice Sotomayor were raising or asking about was that, how does this make much sense in the real world? But let me just follow up on their questions. If you gave notice with everything, including the time and place, and then sent a second document with a new time and place, that's okay, correct?
",-0.17731259763240814
1671,19-863,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1624.38,1638.48," So, counsel, I take it that under the government's approach, there's no dispute that the stop-time rule starts running when notice is complete, so i.e. when the non-citizen receives the time and place of the hearing, is that correct?
",-1.3248127698898315
1672,19-863,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1654.98,1680," Okay. So here's my question: Justice Alito was saying, and and you agreed, that the stop-time rule would run when notice was complete, even if the government used a dummy date or a date that was 99 percent certain to be changed in the initial notice that contained everything. So why isn't this rule actually worse for non-citizens because it'll mean that the stop-time rule starts running earlier?
",-0.33097946643829346
1673,19-863,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1718.725,1782.16," Well, I think that's true. But, if DHS really can't coordinate with, you know, immigration courts because it can't put things on their docket, it may have no choice, you know, if the software doesn't handle things in every situation, but to give a date that it hopes for, but this rule would force them to put that date down. Let me let me go back to Justice Kagan's question. So she pointed out that another way to satisfy this rule would be to send essentially what would be a draft notice containing all information except time and place the first time around, and then later, once the time and place was set, send the notice that would actually trigger the stop-time rule that contained all the information. And you conceded that would be sufficient, but you resisted it. And I'm wondering why you're resisting it, because wouldn't it be better under Justice Kagan's hypothetical for the immigrant to have more information and to know in the beginning, well, this is what's coming? We're going to be initiating, you know, removal proceedings based on this information, and you can expect to hear the time and date late later, and that's when the stop-time rule will will happen. Why do you resist --
",0.4266936182975769
1674,19-863,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2014.61,2032.96," Mr. Yang, you can fix this whole problem or at least moot the dispute simply by sending a copy of the notice to appear when you send a notice of when the new hearing date is or when a hearing date is?
",-1.2481645345687866
1675,19-863,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2067.13,2104.59," But why why would that I'm sure you understand the intricacies more than I do, but whoever is sending out the updated notice to appear or the original notice to appear, you know, just has to attach what they've someone has already sent, which is the original notice, notice to appear. Now, if it's the fact that the immigration office has to to take the prosecutorial information and staple it together or the other way around, it doesn't seem to me that that should be terribly administratively burdensome.
",0.6588582396507263
1676,19-863,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2402.88,2450.75000005," As far as I understand this, there's a statute and it says that written notice, which means a notice to appear, a notice to appear, shall be sent to the alien, containing a number of things, and one of them is the time and the place of hearing. It seems to me, if you read it, it says send a notice, a notice, not four notices, a notice to appear which contains the following. All right? And if you look at it practically, you say, well, if you if you have more than one document with some of this information, people are going to get mixed up. The aliens might get mixed up. On the other hand, it's more burdensome to the government. So I see things on both sides of the practicalities of it, so why don't we just go with the language?
",0.3544999957084656
1677,19-863,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2633.855,2664.835," Mr. Yang, I gather that the decision in this case will be important for a number of cases that arose before Pereira and maybe for some time after that, but what is the importance of a question for cases going forward? Mr. Zimmer says that the government is now providing time and place in the notice to appear. So what is the significance of this case for future cases?
",-1.6290282011032104
1678,19-863,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2768.06,2794.955," Well, Mr. Zimmer says you have an easy solution. You could just ascertain what is the average time between the serve between the service of a notice to appear and the date and the time and place and put that on the notice to appear, and that would invoke the stop-time rule. If it turns out to be inaccurate even 99 percent of the time, that doesn't bother him.
",0.08308502286672592
1679,19-863,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2858.13,2990.97," Mr. Yang, I it is somewhat an unusual situation because it's not as if the rule that you're the other side is asking us to implement stops the alien from being detained or changes the course of his or her hearing. Everything goes on. The only issue is whether the government gets the benefit of the stop-gap rule. And, there, the other side says there is an inherent value in having all of the information that is necessary that is specified under the under the statute explicitly. It says a notice of appeal a notice a notice to appear must include these six or seven or eight items, and that's what entitles you to the benefit the statute confers against the alien and on the government. And you haven't really answered for me why that makes no sense and why your argument that you would be entitled to send out seven or eight pieces of paper, each one containing the individual items required under the statute, and then, when you got to the end of all of them, the stop-gap rule comes into effect, but the alien can't really know because it can't control you from sending those notices out a month, two months, three months apart, six months apart, eight months apart. At some point, the alien's not going to know what you're talking about when you send the piece of paper. So please tell me why your logic makes more sense than the commonsense logic of the statute says a notice to to appear must have all of these items in it.
",0.5062748193740845
1680,19-863,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3048.51,3063.21," They still they they still have that remedy. But, if you give them that information all at once, they no longer have a defense if they fail to show up at the specified hearing date. That's what your adversary's saying.
",0.2009400725364685
1681,19-863,Elena_Kagan_,3100.69,3178.32499995," Mr. Yang, your answer to Justice Thomas suggests to me that your statutory interpretation must be wrong, in other words, the idea that the government could separate out notice into seven different documents if it wanted to. You know, the nature of the proceedings would be in one document, and the charges would be in another document, and so forth and so on. I I mean, that just seems wrong to me, and and and so that makes me look harder at the statutory language. And, indeed, the statutory language seems to cut very much against you, that there is a definition here of the phrase ""notice to appear."" And the statutory definition says that that phrase means written notice specifying the following things. And if we do what we usually do with a statutory definition, we just sort of plug in the definition in place of the defined term, we get a pretty clear answer on the stop-time rule, that that that the period of presence ends when the alien is served a, and then you substitute this language, a written notice specifying the following. And that seems pretty clear to me. It's a written notice specifying the following, one piece of paper specifying the following.
",0.6883698105812073
1682,19-863,Elena_Kagan_,3189.52,3222.69," No, but the definition doesn't have the article ""a,"" but the stop-time rule does have the article ""a."" In other words, the definition the defined phrase is simply ""notice to appear,"" and notice and so then you would put in written notice specifying the following. You already have the article ""a"" in the defined term, the in in the in the operative statute. Then the definition comes after that ""a."" But, if you read it as a whole, it's a written notice specifying the following.
",-0.6982733607292175
1683,19-863,Elena_Kagan_,3283.68,3329.5," I mean I mean, it seems to me this is perfectly clear. The way you want us to read it, you would say, well, you could when the alien is served a ""a"" notice to appear. But, anyway, I I I think it's pretty clear, Mr. Yang. But I'll I'll let me if you said a notice of appeal, right, do you think that you could let let's say that there was language that said that the losing party in a lawsuit has to provide written notice appealing a decision within 30 days. If and and even that, so this is without the parenthetical, and suppose somebody said: Okay, I'm going to send you two pieces of paper. On the first piece of paper, I'm going to give you my name. In the second piece of paper, I'm going to give you the judgment that I'm appealing from. How would that work out?
",-0.06226688250899315
1684,19-863,Neil_Gorsuch_,3352.96,3375.185," Mr. Yang, I'd like to just step back a moment and I guess I'm curious why the government is pursuing this at all given Pereira. I know it doesn't squarely address this, but I would have thought the government might have taken the hint from an eight-justice majority in Pereira that ""notice of appeal"" means what it what it seems to mean.
",-0.19042548537254333
1685,19-863,Neil_Gorsuch_,3398.11,3434.855," The government the government, Mr. Yang, doesn't have to argue every every possible jot and tittle of of a statute. It it can it it has discretion here. It's just interesting to me that it's chosen to exercise it the way it has. Let me ask you this: What if what if I had a law clerk and I said in my manual in my law clerk manual I want a bench memorandum analyzing the facts, the law, and your proposed disposition, and instead of providing that, my law clerk provided three separate memos, each detailing various views of the facts, four more on the law, and then, I don't know, a couple on proposed dispositions. Would that be a bench memorandum?
",-0.33333978056907654
1686,19-863,Neil_Gorsuch_,3453.89,3479.355," Let me ask you this about the government has actually mustered the courage to make a Chevron step 2 argument here, which is interesting to me. Why should the government get if there's ambiguity here at the end of the day, after we exhaust everything, why should the government presumptively win? What about Saint Cyr and the deportation canon that suggests that ambiguity should be resolved in favor of a presumptively free individual?
",-0.1298956274986267
1687,19-863,Neil_Gorsuch_,3514.97,3529.88," Okay. Last last last question then, from arises from that is how much ambiguity do we need to have, in the government's view, before we resort to Chevron step 2? A tie? You know, do you want us to use some adjectives? Grievous?
",-0.6790328621864319
1688,19-863,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3552.16,3575.525," Good morning, Mr. Yang. I just want to make sure I understand the ramifications here of each side's position. If you were to lose, the IJ, the immigration judge, could still reject cancellation of removal and remove the non-citizen; it would just be discretionary rather than mandatory. Is that correct?
",-1.035455584526062
1689,19-863,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3641.075,3673.72," To follow up on something Justice Thomas raised and then Justice Kagan followed up on, and just to make sure I understand your answer on the six or seven notices point, I understood you to say, but correct me if I'm wrong, that the actual operation of the system and the structure of the overall statute operates as a a deterrent on the government doing any such thing because it just makes no sense for the government to do that. I think that's what I understood you to say. And I want to make --
",0.4670422077178955
1690,19-863,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3722.03,3739.52," I'm sorry. One last thing, Mr. Yang. I think Justice Kagan was suggesting that if your textual argument were right, the quote mark should be around ""a notice to appear,"" not just around ""notice to appear."" Can you follow up on that?
",-0.9793165326118469
1691,19-863,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3782.725,3830.005," Mr. Yang, I want to go back to the difficulty that you described when aliens are detained by border agents. You were talking about this in response to some questions by Justice Thomas. And you said, in that case, you have to issue the NTA immediately, or within 48 hours, but you don't necessarily know at that point where the detention facility will be. So here's my question. I mean, presumably, now you're handling that by, within 48 hours, issuing a notice to appear that has all information except the time and the place of the hearing. Why can't you then, once the alien is put in a detention facility, at that point issue an NTA that has all the information because now they're in a detention facility and you know where they are?
",-0.34738537669181824
1692,19-863,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3869.52,3888.01000005," No, no, no. I'm not saying you rely on the immigration court setting a date. I'm saying that once a non-citizen is put in a detention facility, can't DHS at that point you know, Justice Alito talked about issuing notices to appear that maybe have estimated dates. I mean, couldn't you do that at that point?
",0.5074816942214966
1693,19-863,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3945.21,3983.75," Counsel, before my time expires, let me ask you one other question. You said that part of the problem in having the immigration court issue the complete notice to to appear that would have the time and date is that the immigration court doesn't like issuing the charges. So part of this seems to derive from the separation between DHS and then having the immigration courts housed within DOJ. But is that just reluctance on the part of the immigration court? Couldn't the immigration court simply include a copy of what you've already sent to the non-citizen, and then on a separate document notice the time and place of the hearing and put them in the same envelope?
",-0.5202333331108093
1694,19-8709,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,128.945,175.275," Thank you, counsel. Let's suppose you have a defendant who is convicted under 922(g) prior to Rehaif and, on appeal, she argues that if she had known she had to establish or the prosecution had to establish a felon that she knew that she was a felon, that she would have introduced mental health evidence to show that she was incapable of that knowledge. In that case, could the reviewing court look at that evidence of mental illness, which was not presented to the jury, not presented in trial, on plain-error review, or or does your rule bar only the prosecution?
",-0.6835599541664124
1695,19-8709,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,212.405,235.21," Well, that that's the basis of my question. I'm not sure why you limit the your analysis in that way. And the fact that there are many, many situations where we obviously do allow consideration of evidence outside the record in assessing a a a claim of trial error, I don't know why this would be treated differently.
",0.09415683895349503
1696,19-8709,Stephen_G_Breyer_,484.17,596.22," Okay. So, here, we have I understand what the error is, substantial rights. Were they affected? I'm on the appeals court. You have to give me some reason to think they were. Okay. What were they? Now you say you only look at but why? Why? Why only look at? The PSA is in the record. Why what what's the rule? I mean, why why why there could have been something that happened before the trial, an error. There could be something that happened in the middle of the trial to which it's highly relevant what happened before the trial. There could be something on the list of witnesses. There could be a limitation on what's going to be asked in the limitation having been worked out by counsel or having been worked out with the judge before the jury was empaneled. I mean, the possibilities are endless. So where does this idea come from, you can only look to certain things? At least where we're we don't have to go beyond saying the record the record, of which the PSA is part, indeed. You could go to sentencing two minutes after the jury comes in with a guilty verdict, same day, within the hour. I mean, you know, it all depends. So so what's wrong with what I'm saying, that there is no rule? The only rule is the defendant has to show that there's a reasonable likelihood that it did affect my substantial rights. And no no appeals court's going to have a big hearing. Put it in the brief. I mean, in other words, I'm totally at sea as to why or how to draw some line. Some case one thing and some case another is my instinct. Could you explain this to me?
",0.38990071415901184
1697,19-8709,Stephen_G_Breyer_,645.26,683.17999995," That's why I asked what's the trial record. You see? Because you could have had it. It depends on what it is. I overstated with an hour, but maybe sometimes an hour. I don't know. Right? The jury's verdict has come in, when the mistake has to do with Witness Smith. Witness Smith has already testified. Don't look to the next witness? You see, I fear that we start getting into the rulemaking business in this area, what you can look at and what you don't for appellate courts, for district courts. Do you see what I'm afraid of? A mess, in other words.

1699,19-8709,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,808.13,834.965," Yeah, I understand your argument. Suppose the defendant was the named plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging the disqualification of convicted felons from voting, or suppose the defendant had written a book about his prison experience, and in the book describing the 10 years he spent in prison, he says, I I was convicted of this felony. Could the court look at any of those?

Do you think that's an issue that needs to be submitted to a jury?
",-0.8455237150192261
1701,19-8709,Sonia_Sotomayor_,961.34,1080.34," Counsel, I think Justice Scalia would have agreed with you in his by his dissent in Neder. But putting that aside, I have two questions that I hope you'll get to in my time. The first is I don't know that the focus of prong 3 and prong 4 are the same. Prong 3, I think, clearly is related to the proceeding at issue: Would he have been found guilty? But prong 4 is talking more broadly about the public's perception of the judicial system as qua system. And so I don't know that the answer to your question is the same with respect to prong 3 and prong 4. I understand your argument that whether this proceeding would have been different, yes, under prong 3, and so that you may have shown prejudice, but, with respect to prong 4, I think that what the public would be looking at, qua the judge as well, is the entire proceeding. And, there, I don't see why a judge can't look at the facts of of a particular case from beginning to end to determine whether the public would have seen this as an injustice. And given all of the circumstances or potential circumstances, some of which are just like this case, that Justice Alito mentioned, your defendant was just released from prison six months before he was arrested for this charge, and he had served either 20 months or 36 months, it's impossible to believe that there's any reasonable doubt that he could have put his knowledge in contention. So why am I looking at this the wrong way?
",0.4136955440044403
1702,19-8709,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1116.64,1204.72500005," That that that is assuming we're we're we're looking just at that proceeding to understand it as an outcome of the trial. But the conviction is the issue. I do have a question in response in your response to Justice the Chief Justice, okay? Certainly, if, on prong 4, the record did show some contravention at the sentencing hearing or, et cetera, that mental health was at issue, the appellate court could look at that. But I take I go a step further. Assuming that because nobody thought knowledge was at issue, that evidence had never made it into the record, I'm not sure that you could present it. As I see Federal Rule 10 Federal Appellate Procedure Rule 10(e)(2)(C), it only allows for corrections of errors in the record to bring in new evidence only if it was in error, and you can and the court can take judicial notice of undisputed facts, but if there's something that's not in the record at all, and I'm talking just the trial record, but not there at all, but it's something you didn't put in because you didn't know it would be at issue, do you know of any way for you to get it before the appellate court?

1703,19-8709,Elena_Kagan_,1225.23,1247.985," Ms. Guagliardo, a couple of things that you've said today has raise have raised have raised a question in my mind, which is, are are you arguing that plain-error review is limited to the trial record in all instructional error cases, or are are you arguing that that's true only in cases where there's been an intervening change in law of the kind we did in Rehaif?
",-1.235010027885437
1704,19-8709,Elena_Kagan_,1278.655,1323.825," Okay. What I'm what I'm more interested in is, if it is that broad question, I mean, how to square that with the entire idea of the plain-error doctrine, because, you know, plain error is meant to encourage timely objections, give the court time to correct it, build a factual record, so on and so forth. But, on your rule, on the broad rule, the defendant can get a bare record if he just stays silent. And, you know, usually a bare record will mean reversal. So wouldn't that approach give the defendant an incentive not to object? And, of course, that won't be true in cases where there's an intervening change in law, but where there's not, isn't isn't he left in a better place than if he did object, and aren't we creating the wrong incentives?

1705,19-8709,Neil_Gorsuch_,1369.4,1393.00999995," Counsel, good morning. I I'd like to understand your Sixth Amendment argument just a little bit better. And the government argues that it proves too much because courts of appeals, when conducting a prejudice analysis of trial within the trial court record, would, on your account, usurp the jury's fact-finding function. What do you say to that concern?
",-0.5682694315910339
1706,19-8709,Neil_Gorsuch_,1405.48,1437.96500005," Well, I'm I'm really not so concerned about Neder as the principle that we often conduct as appellate judges a prejudice analysis of trial court errors, and we don't think of that as usurping the Sixth Amendment function of the jury because we're dealing with a forfeited error. And it's the forfeiture that that cuts the Gordian knot of the Sixth Amendment concern. That's normally how we conceive of it. That's how the government conceives of it. You obviously see it differently, and I just want to understand how.
",1.2882314920425415
1707,19-8709,Neil_Gorsuch_,1447.87,1465.08500005," But that's but that that's due to the forfeiture, the government would say, and and and that that's what allows, again, whether it's in the trial record or out of the trial record, us as appellate judges to conduct a prejudice analysis without infringing the jury's functions.
",-0.24508368968963623
1708,19-8709,Neil_Gorsuch_,1484.17,1505.895," So let me try it one more time and I'll I'll and I'll stop there, but why wouldn't the same concerns apply when we're looking at matters within the trial record when we're assessing a forfeited argument and we're asking, as we always do, with just even within the trial record, whether that would have made a difference to a jury?

I think your argument has to be as a matter of theory that your client might have been acquit acquitted if proper instructions had been given because he did not know that he'd committed those qualifying felonies. That at least has to be the theory. And the government says the Old Chief stipulation is really quite inconsistent with any such theory and prevented the government from introducing evidence about the felonies, which would, as the government says, reinforce the natural inference that the defendant was undoubtedly aware of that criminal record when he possessed the gun. And other courts have pointed out it's not something you're likely to forget to begin with. So your response to to that argument?

You know, you've gotten a lot of questions today pointing out the distinction between step 3 and step 4 in the plain-error analysis, you know, and Justice Alito was asking you questions about, you know, what if the defendant had written a book about his experience as a felon and on and on. In your view, do steps 3 and 4 do anything distinct? Because then the government's pointed out, and I think many of the questions you've gotten show, that step 3 maybe has a jury focus, but step 4 doesn't have anything to do with what the jury would think. It has to do more with what the public would think. Do you see them as having any kind of different function, or, essentially, under your analysis, do we just stop at step 3 because, if it would have led to a different result, then there's no need really to do anything different in step 4?
",-0.13456961512565613
1711,19-8709,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2044.97,2073.995," So does it depend on the nature of what they're looking at? In other words, let's say that what what they want the reviewing court wants to consider evidence of a discussion between, you know, two other prisoners or whatever in which, you know, the discussion is, well, they so-and-so knew that it was a felony, and why that's what he told me, and so on and so forth. Can can they just look at that, or does it depend upon the admissible nature of the evidence?

1712,19-8709,Clarence_Thomas_,2343.12,2363.965," The Old Chief seems to have limited the ways in which the government can challenge stipulations or at least craft the whole analysis of stipulations. Do we have to address Old Chief to in order for you to win?
",-0.7050098180770874
1713,19-8709,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2416.075,2457.62," Well, one quick question. It seems to favor you, but you're going to hear a rebuttal, so I mean, look, there's an error, okay, at the trial. It seems like it's absolutely harmless. It had to do with what the weather was like on a certain day, was it raining, and the defendant was walking out in the middle of it and would have known, you know? I mean, okay. But, actually, there is a defense, you know, and it has to do with the defense is it's something that's not in the record. Is there anything to prevent the the defendant from telling the court of appeals that? I mean, they can argue it in the brief.

They don't have to the court of appeals doesn't have to make any finding, does it? I mean, it just has to send it back. Am I right or wrong about that? I wasn't a trial judge, but I was an appeals court judge.

1715,19-8709,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2484.47,2516.975," No, I want to know how it works. I mean, I would have thought, trying to remember, that if the appellant, who was the defendant, had some extra evidence that they didn't put in because of the error, they would tell the appeals court that and, indeed, describe it. And if they didn't find out about it until late in the appeal, they'd file an extra brief. Am I right about that?
",-0.11498328298330307
1716,19-8709,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2518.98,2568.595," Okay. If I'm right about that, then I get to my more difficult question for me. Surely, there is some limit about what the court of appeals could look at. How would you describe it? I mean, I I have a pretty good intuitive idea, I think. You don't want to be unfair. You don't want to go too far. You have to recognize the comparative expertise of appeals courts and district courts. You have to understand the difficulty of getting evidence, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. I could list some practical factors. What I can't figure out how to do and this is the advantage the other side has here I can't figure out how to embody when it goes too far in a form of words.

1717,19-8709,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2574.98,2603.595," Have you thought of some words as to when it goes too far? You think confining it to ""trial record""? I don't know what the trial record is exactly really. But but you want to go beyond that? Of course, you can go beyond that. You say fine. When does it go too far? If you were me, what words would you write in the opinion to describe when it goes too far and when it doesn't?
",-0.2071572244167328
1718,19-8709,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2618.51,2652.385," No, that's your case. But, if I go beyond that, like Justice Alito's book, Justice Alito's book wasn't in the record. Is there ever a time when you can go beyond the record? Maybe so. What about the weather report? What about I mean, you know, things that seem absolutely obvious. What about a you know, so so I'm not certain I want to say maybe we don't answer it. Maybe we just say record as you say. But but I just wondered if you thought about that and if if you have a form of words.

1719,19-8709,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2677.86,2746.665," Suppose there's a case where the defendant would have a a plausible claim, maybe a more than plausible claim, that he or she did not recall a felony conviction. Let's say it's it occurred 20 years ago, the the offense was not labeled a felony under state law, but it qualifies under the felon-in-possession statute, the defendant was sentenced to probation. So there's a potential defense there if the issue had been if the the trial judge had anticipated our decision. Could could the in in determining whether there was plain error, could the government rely on, let's say, an affidavit by somebody who spoke to the defendant shortly before the defendant was arrested and the affidavit says the defendant said, well, you know, I know I'm a I was convicted of a felony and I can't have a gun, but I really feel bad, I must have a gun for self-defense?

1720,19-8709,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2805.51,2833.635," Well, no, I understand this is a different case, but but back to my my hypothetical case, would it be improper for the appeals court to consider the affidavit? And, if so this is similar to the question, I think, Justice Breyer was trying to get an answer to what is the standard that should be applied in that situation? Is it just a question of of basic fairness, reliability?
",-0.7939965724945068
1721,19-8709,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2853.335,2949.58," So you were about to make to say something, a concession of some sort when you were being questioned, I believe, by one of my colleagues. There does seem to be an unfairness to a defendant in this situation who doesn't know knowledge is at is at issue and who may not have created a record about knowledge, but he has all sorts of evidence to show mental illness, all of the factors that Justice Alito set forth, mental illness or he was young, the judge told him it didn't tell him it was a felony, his lawyer didn't. Under state law, it wasn't classified as a felony. But none of that is in the record. You seem to concede he could put that into the appellate record. I just don't see what rule gives him an opportunity to do that, number one. Number two, if there's no explicit rule, are you willing to concede that we should say there is that assumption? And then, number three, going back to Justice Breyer's question, is it an is it an equal or unequal opportunity? Do you have a chance to put forth countervailing evidence? And at what point does the appellate court become a trier of fact rather than a reviewer of legal error? Because, if you're going to let the government put in all its counter-evidence that's not in the record, don't we become triers of fact?

1722,19-8709,Elena_Kagan_,3063.205,3144.495," Mr. Snyder, if I could continue with your answers to Justice Alito's question, I mean, he posited the government coming in with entirely outside-of-the-record evidence, a new witness of some kind. And, of course, in in this case, it's about a a a kind of peripheral issue, but that won't always be the case in instructional error cases. You know, it might the instructional error might go to the very heart of the case. You know, it might go to something like the defendant's intent. And and and then, as I understood what you were saying to Justice Alito, you were saying, well, the government could bring in all kinds of new witnesses as to that issue on which there was an instructional error, and that would be okay. It would just be that maybe the the the defendant would have a better prong 4 claim on the merits. And I guess, you know, I don't exactly understand why the defendant would have a better prong 4 claim on the merits. And maybe, more importantly, I don't understand really why that's the question as to how the test would come out in the end as opposed to trying to put some limits on what the government can do in a case like this.

1723,19-8709,Elena_Kagan_,3171.71,3197.98," Wait, wait. If if I just understood you correctly, Mr. Snyder, you basically said that what you just what you said previously to Justice Alito, that you could be fine with that not being a part of our holding, that you know, basically, that this case involves only record evidence and would be different from a case that where the evidence was outside the record. Is that right?

1724,19-8709,Neil_Gorsuch_,3239.535,3272.985," Good morning, counsel. I I I'd like to just understand how this argument that you propose for Rule 52(b) interacts with how we'd interpret 52(a), which we often look at together. If we were to rule for you in this case, would we have to say that when a court conducts a 52(a) analysis, a harmless-error analysis, it's likewise not constricted to the trial court record and can look at other things in the in the district court record?
",-0.6137171387672424
1725,19-8709,Neil_Gorsuch_,3285.61,3297.335," Put put aside prong 4 for a moment. Just at prong 3, if we were to decide it there, would we necessarily have to resolve even there the 52(a) issue, or is there a way to distinguish the two cases?
",-1.4381811618804932
1726,19-8709,Neil_Gorsuch_,3313.8,3344.75," Do you think do you think we would have a greater Sixth Amendment concern in deciding whether a piece of evidence was harmless in its presentation or absence if if it's not even before the jury at all? I mean, you know, typically, we say it was harmless error that this this wasn't presented or this was presented given the overwhelming weight of evidence that the jury had before it. It would be very different it might be different, I don't know, if it's outside the trial court record altogether.

I just want to follow up on the Old Chief stipulation and just get your view on the significance of that. Is it your position that the Old Chief stipulation makes it impossible for plain error to be satisfied?
",-1.007995367050171
1728,19-8709,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3432.73,3472.97," And how how would that evidence just play that out. How how in a case where there was an Old Chief stipulation, and, obviously, that's just a lawyer, as opposing counsel pointed out, but in the you you make a big point of that in the brief in your brief and on page 28 seemed to say a defendant who not only failed to raise an objection but also affirmatively utilized the existing law to foreclose the introduction of evidence that would have powerfully demonstrated his knowledge of his status cannot demand that a later later reviewing court overlook his overlook his forfeiture while adhering to the earlier evidentiary limitations. That sounded pretty categorical to me.
",0.23855173587799072
1729,19-8709,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3528.845,3562.28," Mr. Snyder. So the Seventh Circuit, in considering this question, drew a line between, you know, trial record evidence or all the evidence in the record, evidence as as a way as a proxy for what's reliable, so things like the P PSR, for example. What would be wrong with that? I mean, that would exclude things like Justice Alito's book, but especially in these cases, the PSR is going to list the felonies, it's going to list the dates of the felonies, it's going to list the length of the sentences. Why does the government want more than that, especially in these cases?
",-0.05460860952734947
1730,19-8709,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3592.56,3615.515," So you would be happy with a decision that said, you know, the the court the court of appeals can go outside of just what the jury saw, what was before the jury, and consider other record evidence like, for example, the PSR, and just not say anything about whether it's possible at step 4 in another case, in a non-Rehaif error case, for the court of appeals to go beyond that?
",-0.4599461257457733
1731,19-8709,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3617.765,3642.26," And then, just to go back to some of Justice Sotomayor's questions, do you agree in that circumstance, if the government could point to the PSR, that the defendant could cast doubt on the reliability of that evidence with things that may go outside of the record, like, for example, you know, mental capacity or other reasons why the defendant may not have known about it or maybe inaccuracies in the PSR?
",-1.3948525190353394
1732,19-508,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,133.295,203.45," Mr. Pattillo, one of the issues with your reading of the statute is that it was passed roughly 50 years ago, and in the intervening years, there's been a significant change in how this Court interprets statute statutes. Back when this one was passed, we had a pretty free-wheeling approach. You know, we weren't as confined to the specific language. You sort of looked at what Congress had in mind and and figured out the meaning in light of that. And, of course, today, we have a more disciplined approach, you know, I think more suited to our role under the Constitution. But shouldn't we construe this statute in the environment in which Congress passed it in light of the, as I said, more free-wheeling approach? And I think there'd be a lot more leeway to your friend on the other side argument about an expansive reading of some of the language. So why why do we sort of adopt a I don't know what it is a view that that is current today but wasn't current back then?
",0.28615984320640564
1733,19-508,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,251.96,278.815," I know that's I know that's what we said. I maybe I just don't find that so so compelling. It's it's it's you know, we try to look at language as it was understood in other contexts when we're interpreting provisions. You know, we go back to the, you know, 1860 treatise and say what did that mean back then, and we don't look at a contemporary dictionary. Do you have any argument besides what we said in Sandoval?

Counsel, let's continuing along the lines of the Chief Justice, let's assume that we did not have Sections 5 and 19 and but you you still have the same language that we have in 13. Would would it be reasonable to say that Congress legislated against in that case, in that instance, against the backdrop of cases like Porter and Mitchell, and, if so, then how would that change your argument?

1735,19-508,Stephen_G_Breyer_,467.715,528.7899999," Good morning. Here, I thought the briefs were very good in this case. Blue brief, I think you're right. Red brief, I think you are right. They can't both be right, that's right. All right. You see that's the old joke, but that's where I am. So I'm pretty familiar with the arguments and I see which way do we go, and the argument, it seems to me, that's against you and I'll put the other half to the other side. The argument that's against you is simply this to me: Law isn't perfect. Courts make mistakes. We make mistakes too. And this, if it is a mistake, has been around for 50 years and there's a pretty uniform interpretation before the Seventh Circuit. And if we never say let bygones be bygones, I mean, we're going to be here to Marbury versus Madison and beyond. So too much time has passed, water under the bridge, good-bye. Why doesn't that apply?
",1.37909996509552
1736,19-508,Stephen_G_Breyer_,547.84,575.21," Oh, just wait. For my question, I'm assuming you're right on all that, okay? My question is still it's close, and still the lower courts at least have been uniform for 50 years. We cannot undo everything that was, in your opinion or mine or somebody else's, decided not perfectly and may be wrong. That's what I just asked.

There, he was, as I understand it, required to return 3 billion dollars. Is that does that encompass the amount of money that's involved here?
",-1.4207664728164673
1738,19-508,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,757.52,818.645," Let me turn back briefly to basically the same question that the Chief Justice asked. If I mean, most of the members of Congress are not lawyers. That was true when this provision was enacted. And even those who were lawyers, perhaps like me, never heard the word ""equity"" when they were in law school. So suppose one of those members said, well, here, we're going to authorize the Commission to seek an injunction, so I'm going to look at the most recent edition of Black's Law Dictionary, which defines an injunction in part as ""a judicial process operating in personam and requiring a person to whom it is directed to do or refrain from doing a particular thing."" If the member read that definition, wouldn't they think that it would authorize exactly what was done here?
",-0.1293203979730606
1739,19-508,Sonia_Sotomayor_,855.25,914.245," Counsel, you argue that there would be no reason for Congress to provide for monetary remedies under Section 19 if the FTC could obtain disgorgement under 13(b). But it makes sense to me that the FTC might sometimes want to establish new rules through agency adjudications that are binding on absent parties and to which courts will defer. So the more important question for me is and I hope you can answer it is, why would Congress authorize the FTC to seek a permanent injunction if no other equitable remedies were available? It seems that under your understanding of the statute, why would the FTC ever pursue a permanent injunction under 13(b) rather than a cease-and-desist order that could lead to monetary relief? It could --
",-0.14770473539829254
1740,19-508,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1007.17,1030.17," So why why even give it a permanent injunction when it wasn't, according to your reading, able to recover anything else under that process? It could always do a temporary injunction and stop impend and stop impending harm that way and then always have to pursue administrative process to get monetary relief. It makes no sense to me.

1741,19-508,Elena_Kagan_,1059.89,1114.83500005," Mr. Pattillo, I'd like to go back to the Chief Justice's first questions about which approach we're supposed to use, our old approach, which was very liberal in finding rights and remedies, or our new approach, which is decidedly not. And you said, well, Alexander v. Sandoval, and the Chief asked you to put that the Chief Justice asked you to put that aside. And I'd like you to put that aside as well. I think it's at least arguably very different. Do you have a a theoretical argument for why it is that we should be using the new approach? Because I would have thought that the whole idea behind the new approach is that what matters most is what Congress thinks about a question, not what the Court thinks about it, and that that would suggest, well, we're supposed to be looking at what Congress thought in 1973 given the backdrop of all of our precedents.

1742,19-508,Elena_Kagan_,1145.45,1163.88," that's an argument I mean, that's an argument on a different point, the point about what Congress would have understood back then, but but I take that to be assuming my premise, which is that the very issue is I mean, that the thing we're supposed to be figuring out is what Congress would have assumed back then, isn't it?
",0.13328322768211365
1743,19-508,Elena_Kagan_,1184.365,1234.495," Sorry, Mr. Pattillo. In in in in just two years before Congress enacted this legislation, the Second Circuit, you know, obviously, an important circuit when it comes to these matters, held that the FTC had power to seek restitution because its statute said that the agency could seek an injunction, the exact same question as is as as we're confronting. And the Second Circuit relies on Porter, relies on Mitchell, relies on all the old cases that you say are distinguishable, and and said yes, an injunction includes restitution according to Supreme Court law on the subject. So doesn't that suggest that the FTC has a pretty good point about what Congress understood in 1973?

I I I think you agree that an injunction can be used to provide certain forms of equitable relief, including restitution perhaps, an accounting, requiring a freezing of assets, or handing over a thing of value, but but it's it it can't go this far. How would you have us draw that line and describe it?

1745,19-508,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1388.415,1445.67," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, counsel. Your argument here is strikingly similar to the argument advanced in the dissent in Porter by Justice Rutledge, joined by Justices Reed and Frankfurter, and the dissent in Mitchell written by Justice Whittaker, joined by Justices Black and Clark. The Rutledge dissent, Justice Rutledge dissent in Porter, for example, said ""Congress could not have been ignorant of the remedy of restitution. It knew how to give remedies it wished to confer. There was no need to add this one, nor do I think it did so. It did not give it expressly."" That kind of argument. What do we do with Porter and Mitchell if we decide this case in your favor?

But you you suggested in your brief that because of the safeguards of Section 19, in particular, you know, the the reasonable man standard, knowing and understanding that the conduct was deceptive, that the FTC couldn't have gotten a monetary remedy from him under 19.

And and courts have broad inherent equitable power. You you don't sort of parse and construe their authority very carefully, at least I don't think so. But this involves an agency, and an agency only has the authority delegated to it by Congress.

I think Justice Brandeis, when he started, was faced with a business community that was very suspicious of the FTC's power and thought it would be abused and a progressive community that thought it's absolutely necessary to bring bad business practices under control. So they compromised. The compromise was you've got to do what the FTC says, but before it tells you to do something, it will find that what you're doing now is wrong. It will find that. It will be a cease-and-desist order, later expanded under Moss-Magnuson, I think, to include violation of a rule. So Section 5, cease-and-desist order or violation of a rule, ha, damage of some kind. Nineteen, the same thing. And now we have right in the middle 13, no protection like that whatsoever. Do not worry, says the FTC, we will only use it in exceptional cases. Ha! In 2012, they repeal that. And now, 10 years later, after this has been in effect for a few years, I read that 100 cases under this provision are in the courts, compared with 10 or 12 under the regular cases. And you say it's just obvious, we're going to get those people who think their bad conduct is obvious. Look at Skechers. Look at the Cardinal case. Go back to the famous Unburn case. Add substantiation. People wouldn't know that it is an unfair practice that a chiropractor who was married to a wife who had some income from the company and therefore is a conclusion as to the muscle toning of the company should be discounted. And that's the kind of case they're bringing now. Now do you see my point? On the one hand, it's well-established law in the lower court. On the other hand, if we interpret it your way, we we we say your fears, business community, were absolutely right. It is now up to the FTC. Before you know the thing is wrong, they hit you with bad damages. This case? Perhaps you're right. But Skechers, Cardinal, even Unburn, build strong bodies eight ways, that was Wonder Bread. They only did it six ways. I mean, you see, it's giving the FTC that that you get my point. Now I'd like to hear an answer.

1755,19-508,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2610.175,2675.66," We asked Mr. Pattillo questions about how this provision would have been understood in 1973. His brief cites comments made by a former FTC official, Mr. FitzGerald, that addresses that directly, and they are pretty damaging to your position. Mr. FitzGerald says that when 13(b) was enacted, nobody on the Commission imagined that it would become an important part of its the Commission's consumer protection program. But the Commission decided that Section 19 was too time-consuming, so it wanted it looked for a workaround, and ""neither the text of 13(b) nor its legislative history disclosed a basis to argue for broad equitable relief. The Commission's attorneys thought these arguments were not going to succeed, but, to their surprise, they were successful."" And you don't say anything about Mr. FitzGerald.

Why would Congress use a different language for injunctive relief in one section and just stop at ""injunctive relief"" and in the other add ""and further equitable relief"" in a different section?

1757,19-508,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2839.84,2890.305," Now I'm following up slightly on Justice Alito's question. Legislative history is not unimportant to me. What am I to make of the fact that I saw nothing in the history of this bill suggesting that Congress understood that Section 13(b) authorizes monetary awards? Quite to the contrary, the prior version of what became Section 19 triggered extensive debate because there wasn't money damages available, and Section 19 was passed to remedy what was perceived as a fault in the bill as it existed. So what am I missing in terms of the absence of anything to do with this issue before Congress?

1758,19-508,Elena_Kagan_,2947.39,3000.86499995," Mr. Marcus, it seems to me that the best argument against your position, and and it's a strong one, comes from Section 5 and Section 19, which have these protections in them that Section 13 do not, that there has to be a repeated violation, that there has to be a certain kind of mens rea and so forth. And and it it does seem as though your interpretation of Section 13 makes those pretty much entirely irrelevant. I mean, you say, well, this is a choice. There are two pathways of different kinds of administrative action. But what what what seems significant about those two pathways as you've led them as you've laid them out, is that one is so clearly better from the agency's perspective. And so I'm wondering if that's the kind of choice that Congress really gave to the agency.
",0.6042144894599915
1759,19-508,Elena_Kagan_,3053.84,3066.285," It seems as though that's exactly why we should maintain the integrity of those protections rather than your interpretation, which essentially makes them irrelevant. It was nice that Congress once thought that, but we don't have to deal with that anymore.

1760,19-508,Neil_Gorsuch_,3171.06,3245.22500005," Well, let let's focus on the consumer protection side because I think the antitrust side, there are a lot more standards out there that people are familiar with. But but Justice Breyer really does remind us of of the history here. The FTC was set up in part to enact rules about deceptive conduct. It chose not to go that route, preferred an enforcement route. And and recognizing that a term like ""deceptive practices"" in Section 5 is not exactly self-defining it may lack some of the substance that we now have at least under the Sherman Act in the antitrust context laid out a bunch of protections in Section 19 before your money can be taken away. We've all kind of wandered around this question, but is isn't I think our core concern is you're rendering that those protections superfluous, that there's very little incentive for the agency to ever comply with them, and it's just a another step away from what Congress had anticipated would be a regulatory regime that's never materialized.

1761,19-508,Neil_Gorsuch_,3296.33,3313.94500005," Yes, but it if it's so terribly difficult, and Section 13 is so comparatively easy, what what incentive remains to do that?

1762,19-508,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3354.24,3456.4," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Marcus. Good to be with you again. I want to pick up on Justice Alito's question and Mr. FitzGerald's article, which I've read. You obviously put forward good arguments on Porter and the Court's precedent and Congress's intent, as well as the body of court of appeals cases, but it seems that the problem you have is the text. And in that sense, this case really is a separation of powers case. I I I worked in the Executive Branch for many years, so I understand how this happens. When you're in the Executive Branch or an independent agency, you want to do good things and prevent or punish bad things, and sometimes your statutory authority is borderline. And it could be war policy or immigration or environmental or what have you, but with good intentions, the agency pushes the envelope and stretches the statutory language to do the good or prevent the bad. The problem is is it results in a transfer of power from Congress to the Executive Branch to decide whether to exercise this new authority. That's a particular concern, at least for me, with independent agencies. So now why isn't the answer here, for the agency to seek this new authority for Congress, for us to maintain the principle that separation of powers, that the agency should stick to the authority in the in the text and not and not go beyond that? A 30,000-foot question. Interested in your responses to that.

1763,19-508,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3536.345,3565.09," Counsel, the the damages award here or the money at stake here was 1.3 billion dollars and then the 27 million dollars collected from Mr. Tucker's wife. And when Justice Alito asked Mr. Pattillo how much of that had been distributed to the victims, he said about 500 million dollars. So I I take it the rest of that is in the Treasury, or does the FTC have it right now?
",-1.2100719213485718
1764,19-508,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3633.49,3661.98999995," But this is what I'm I'm getting at. It seems to me that equitable remedies attempt to restore the plaintiff to the position in which the plaintiff stood before the plaintiff was defrauded. This money isn't traceable back to the SEC, and the money that's gained isn't all being distributed to the plaintiffs. So it seems like it functions almost more like a fine. It doesn't really seem analogous to, say, restitution to me.

1765,18-1259,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,136.45,172.58," Mr. Shapiro, I'm having just a little trouble figuring out what exactly it is that you're looking for. We know it can't be a formal finding, as I think you indicated, because of Miller and Montgomery's statements. And, obviously, you want more than just a hearing at which you'd have an opportunity to raise the the arguments. But what is it in the middle there? Is it just a statement on the record at some point during during a hearing? Is it, I don't know, some kind of informal hearing finding? What exactly do you do you need?
",-0.24037174880504608
1766,18-1259,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,233.93,283.905," Well, at the hearing that took place here, the the irreparable corruption, I guess, was the label they used. That was certainly argued by the the counsel. You know, he said, you you have to distinguish between a juvenile offender whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity and the rare offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption. The judge certainly referred to Miller, said he considered each and every factor that is identifiable in Miller, and concluded that the Petitioner was not entitled to the benefit of the leniency provided in Miller. I mean, is the problem really just that the judge didn't quote enough passages from Miller? He certainly cited it.

1767,18-1259,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,327.67,352.485," Well, this the evidence of what he said at the hearing, I think, it's not a finding of a historical fact. And you talk about things like intellectual disability and and the like. Permanent incorrigibility strikes me as different. It's more a judgment rather than a specific fact. And, from that perspective, I'm just not sure what he said isn't isn't enough.

1768,18-1259,Clarence_Thomas_,385.75,421.215," Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, following up on the Chief Justice's line of questioning, what if the judge did exactly what you said was required and stated on the record that there had to be a finding of permanent incorrigibility and went on to do exactly what was done here? Wouldn't it be implicit in that sentencing that he made, that the judge made, the finding of permanent incorrigibility?
",-0.9327846169471741
1769,18-1259,Clarence_Thomas_,585.425,615.75," I'd like one more try at a world without Montgomery. Would you tell me whether or not you think without, again, the gloss of Montgomery you think that Miller is a substantive rule or a procedural rule? And, if you think it is substance, again, without the gloss of Montgomery, give me an an indication of why you think that.
",-0.7323399186134338
1770,18-1259,Stephen_G_Breyer_,653.755,690.4," I would follow up on Justice Thomas and just say what if you were writing the opinion for the court in this case, how would you put it? Our first part, I think, is fairly easy. You say, in Miller, we decided you can only sentence you cannot sentence a juvenile to life without parole unless he is permanently incorrigible. The State has leeway to decide the procedure through which this decision will be made. And now what?

There's a actually a famous quote by Gandhi, who says exactly that. There are a lot of Christians who believe that. You think of the of the good thief on the cross. So, I mean, what if a judge says, you know, wow, the Supreme Court says I have to determine whether this person is capable of redemption, I I believe that every human being is capable of redemption? What do you do with that?
",0.673865020275116
1773,18-1259,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,957.315,1003.36," Now you read both Miller and Montgomery very broadly, and there certainly is some language in both opinions that you are able to cite, but, if we look strictly at the holdings in those cases, what Miller held and this is what it said expressly we therefore hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life imprisonment life in prison without the possibility of parole for juvenile offenders. And what Montgomery said was: We hold that Miller set out a substantive rule. And what followed from that was that it was retroactive. So, if we just follow the holdings of those cases, we get to a much narrower rule of law than the one that you're proposing. Isn't that the case?
",0.2638034224510193
1774,18-1259,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,1024.93,1047.82," All right. Well, let me ask you just one one more question before my time has has expired. What would you say to any members of this Court who are concerned that we have now gotten light years away from the original meaning of the Eighth Amendment and who are reluctant to go any further on this travel into space?
",-0.7178812026977539
1775,18-1259,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1079.585,1100.875," Counsel, in your cert petition and in your briefing, you frame the question presented as a narrow one about the need for an express finding of permanent incorrigibility. You did not seek cert on the question of what other procedures Miller might require, correct?
",-1.5306249856948853
1776,18-1259,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1117.66,1180.67," So, if you understand that Miller, because it said it, didn't require an express finding, in sentencing, for example, in regular sentencing, a district court judge says: I've considered the factors in 3553(a) and this is the sentence that I think is adequate. And we say that's enough. Here, the judge said: I've considered Miller and all of the factors it talks about. And it's just been told that one of them, most importantly, is incorrigibility. And I don't see the State in that transcript arguing otherwise, meaning that incorrigibility is not significant. In fact, they address it and made the argument he was incorrigible. So, under those circumstances, why isn't that the beginning and end of this case, i.e., the judge made an adequate finding under Miller?

1777,18-1259,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1216.81,1242.855," Well, then you're getting back to you want magic words, because I don't see how this is any different than a regular sentencing where a judge says this is I've considered the 3553 factors. We don't question whether they did it or didn't do it. We take them at their word. And that was the entire argument at the sentencing.
",0.3392374515533447
1778,18-1259,Elena_Kagan_,1312.865,1386.57," Mr. Shapiro, what what you just said is exactly what I want to ask you about, because your argument is that Miller and Montgomery set out not just a process, not just a rule that you'd have to be considered, but, instead, a rule a rule a substantive rule that you can give an LWOP sentence only to a small category of people, call them the irredeemables or the incorrigibles or what have you. And the government and Mississippi contest that understanding, and I want to get your reaction to their arguments. What the government says is that all this talk about incorrigibles, that's just really a label for the final judgment that a court reaches after it considers youth during sentencing. And what Mississippi says, in addition, is it says that the whole point of Miller was just to prevent against the excessive risk of of of disproportionate punishment but that the essence of it is a procedural requirement about considering youth. So why aren't they right?
",0.22474384307861328
1779,18-1259,Elena_Kagan_,1475.22,1523.605," And, Mr. Shapiro, this goes back to a question that Justice Thomas asked you, but let's assume that you're right about what Montgomery says, and, as you say, Montgomery said it not one time or two times or three times but, like, something like seven or eight times. But suppose you think that that's an aggressive reading of Miller, that there that although you said, you know, on page 479 Miller says this, that that wasn't really the thrust of Miller, and, in fact, Montgomery, you know, read it quite aggressively and that there's a gap between the two. If if that's right I mean, you can first tell me whether you think that's right, but, if it's right, which opinion should we look to and why?

1780,18-1259,Neil_Gorsuch_,1607.09,1647.745," Good morning, counsel. I'd actually like to pick up more or less where you left off with Justice Kagan. Let let's assume for the moment that we might view Miller as a procedural requirement and a modest one and Montgomery as as significantly expanding and maybe creating a new substantive right in during the process of purportedly doing the Teague analysis. What do we do with that? I mean, if if it did create a new right and just work with me on that assumption and a new substantive right, wouldn't we need then a subsequent decision deciding whether that new right should be retroactively applied under the Teague plurality analysis?
",-0.46803879737854004
1781,18-1259,Neil_Gorsuch_,1699.215,1751.64500005," But it is a little unusual in the name of purportedly deciding the retroactivity question under Teague to then create a new right and then not consider whether it should be applied retroactively. It's a it's a little bit of an anomaly, which maybe raises for me the next question: What about Teague? I mean, we've been applying this plurality opinion from Teague for some time, watershed rules of criminal procedure, we never found one, and substantive constitutional rules, and and we wind up turning a procedural rule into a substantive rule in order to become in order to have it have retroactive effect. You know, it kind of it kind of brings to mind Justice Jackson in Brown versus Allen, you know, second-guessing all these state final judgments. You know, from original matter at least, what authority do we have to be reconsidering state final judgments in this way?

You started today by referring to settled law, but then you said that the paragraph in Montgomery had created confusion. But the paragraph in Montgomery is part of the part of the law, of course, and I guess I'm not seeing it as that as all that confusing at least on its own. I know your Teague point, but, on its own, it seems very clear in saying multiple times in that paragraph that a finding of fact about incorrigibility is not required. First question: Do you agree that a finding of fact regarding incorrigibility is not required?

1784,18-1259,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1944.22,1993.775," Okay. So let me ask you this: When the sentencing scheme is discretionary, won't the judge necessarily consider youth and, in particular, because defense counsel will invariably raise the defendant's youth as a reason not to impose life without parole, and and even apart from that, that will be the common sense of the situation when you're dealing with someone who committed a crime at 15, as we have here, that you'll be considering that. That'll really be the centerpiece, you would think, in most cases. So, when the judge then determines that the sentence should be life without parole, won't the judge necessarily have made that informal finding or that judgment or that conclusion that you're seeking?

1785,18-1259,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2025.975,2065.36999995," Okay. And by analogy to the death penalty mitigating circumstances context, there, as you know, we the Court over many years has required consideration of mitigating circumstances but, in that context, does not require any particular finding of fact or any particular conclusion. It leaves it to the sentencer to make that judgment based on consideration of all the circumstances. I'm putting aside for the moment the the requirement that there be one aggravating circumstance. But, beyond that, there's no particular finding necessary. Isn't that a similar situation to what we have here?

Why can't you then you know, if you argued below that he was not permanently incorrigible and, essentially, you know, one way of looking at what the trial court did is did not make a finding, did not say he was permanently incorrigible, and you're saying as a matter this is a violation of the Eighth Amendment then to sentence him to life without parole, why can't you just raise that challenge, you've preserved it, and raise it on appeal?

Did the Court say that? I think yes, okay? So assume I'm right on that, yes, that's a substantive rule. But then my question is the same as Justice Barrett's. Why isn't that the end of the case? Judges do decide substantive rules all the time. And the question is, well, did they get the rule right? And so, if the lawyer tells the judge the rule and maybe he's inadequate if he doesn't and then the judge starts talking about balancing factors, and then the Supreme Court starts talking about balancing factors in that state, well, they haven't got the law right, substantive law.

1795,18-1259,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3009.32,3088.77499995," Counsel, my problems with this case go a lot deeper than these procedural questions that have rightly occupied well, have occupied most of the argument. I don't really understand exactly what we are talking about. There are a lot of statements in Miller and Montgomery, and one of them, which a lot of the argument has focused on, is the statement that a judge has to determine whether a particular defendant's crime, a particular minor's crime reflects transient immaturity or incorrigibility, as if those are the opposite sides of the of the same coin. But they're not. A crime could reflect transient a a a crime could reflect transient immaturity. A person a a minor could be completely mature and yet capable of being rehabilitated. So what are we talking about? And and keep in mind that, of the three purposes of punishment that the Court identified and applied in Miller and Montgomery, the first, which is retribution, has nothing whatsoever to do with rehabilitation.

1796,18-1259,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3150.415,3238.51000005," Counsel counsel, Montgomery says repeatedly on 734 and in other places that Miller did more than require a sentencer to consider a juvenile offender's youth before life without parole. So merely considering youth can't be enough under Montgomery. It established that the penological justification for life without parole collapsed in light of the distinct distinctive attributes of youth. More than once, it says: ""Even if a court considers a child's age before sentencing him or her to a lifetime in prison, that sentence still violates the Eighth Amendment for a child whose crime reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity."" Proportionality of sentencing looks at the nature of the crime. But Miller and Montgomery made very clear that we're looking at the nature of the offender. So is it your position that if a sentencing court says I've considered the Miller factors, but I think the crime and the crime does not reflect permanent incorrigibility, but I'm going to sentence him to LWOP anyway because the crime was really horrific?

1798,18-1259,Elena_Kagan_,3351.895,3405.245," Ms. Nobile, I guess what I'm struggling with here is how, on your theory, we could have labeled Miller a substantive rule in Montgomery, because I always thought that a substantive rule under Teague meant that there was a class of people who you couldn't you know, you either couldn't criminalize their conduct or you couldn't sentence them to a certain way. But that that was the question, that there was a class of people for whom a particular punishment was impermissible. And and you're saying that that's not what Montgomery does. But, if it's not what Montgomery does, if Montgomery is only basically ensuring that a certain kind of process is accomplished, then how could Montgomery be saying that Miller was retroactive?

1799,18-1259,Elena_Kagan_,3455.38,3470.6," Okay. So if I can again, I guess what you're saying is if there's a process rule, and that process is necessary to prevent a serious potential for bad substantive outcomes, then that's enough under Teague, is that correct?

Because Mr. Jones is on direct appeal from resentencing, do you think he needs the right he seeks to be retroactively applicable under Teague, or is that just neither here nor there?

1801,18-1259,Neil_Gorsuch_,3538.52,3566.36," Okay, okay. So we're on direct review, and we're just trying to figure out what to do with it. Let let let's say we we think that Miller was a decision about processes and that Montgomery did what Justice Kagan described and created a class of persons or a substantive right for a class of persons. What do what do we do about that? If if if Montgomery misstated the rule from Miller, what do we how do we proceed?

1802,18-1259,Neil_Gorsuch_,3600.61,3637," Well, but that's that's not normally how we think of rights. We think of some rights as process rights, regardless of what the substantive outcome. In a substantive right, you have a right to a substantively reasonable sentence sentence, for example, no matter what the process was that led to it. They're independent. They're complementary, to be sure, but one could be violated without the other. So that that's normally how we think about it. And I guess you're asking us I think you're asking us basically to ignore substantive aspects of Montgomery and just just acknowledge that it misread Miller. Am I wrong about that?

1803,18-1259,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3686.285,3758.18," Good morning, Ms. Nobile. Mr. Shapiro said we shouldn't analogize this situation to Lockett in the death penalty context but, rather, to Atkins and Ford and consider this, in essence, an eligibility requirement with a finding of some kind, not just a process that considers youth as a factor. And that raises, of course, the tension that Justice Kagan was identifying in Montgomery. And I think what she was getting at is that the key paragraph in Montgomery that says no finding of fact is required is, some would say, in tension with the conclusion that Miller was a substantive rule. Okay? And so, if that's true and you've made an attempt to reconcile it, and I think you make a a good point on that. But suppose that's true, and we either have to follow the paragraph in Montgomery or follow the implication of the Teague conclusion and really say that paragraph is wrong in Montgomery or back away from it, which Justice Gorsuch was getting at, a long lead-up to a bottom-line question: Why shouldn't we just require a finding of fact that the defendant is permanently incorrigible?

I understand your submission to be that the requirement here is purely procedural.

Let's say that I'm a sentencer and I go through a hearing, and at the end of the hearing, I say: I've considered this defendant's youth and the attendant characteristics of youth. I've done all that consideration. He's given me a lot of argument. I've listened to it all. To be honest, I don't think that he his crime reflects irreparable corruption. You know, he is not one of the incorrigibles that Montgomery and Miller talk about. I think, in fact, that it's possible that he could be rehabilitated. But I also don't think that his youth is sufficiently mitigating for this horrible crime that he committed. So I'm sentencing him to life without parole. I think that that would be a good punishment and a proportionate punishment. Is that okay on your on your theory?

What's necessary is that a a judge take into account youth and consider it. And and I think Ms. Nobile talked about an ""all things considered"" way. And this judge has done that. He's considered youth in an ""all things considered"" way. He's balanced it against a whole bunch of other factors. And he said that, notwithstanding the possibility of rehabilitation, an LWOP sentence is appropriate. Is that not right?

If the process was good and perfect, my understanding is that you can't raise a different Eighth Amendment argument that the individual sentence was still disproportionate. The answer to that is the process is what leads to the proportionality, at least as an Eighth Amendment matter. And by analogy, in the death penalty context, the Gregg versus Georgia context, we have said proportionality is required, but it's achieved in two ways. One, you rule out the death penalty or life without parole for a certain class of offenses or offenders. And, secondly, we require that the sentencer consider all the relevant mitigating and other relevant circumstances. That's the Lockett principle. And, here, I just want to make sure of your answer. If the if the process considers all the relevant circumstances, is there a separate argument, as an Eighth Amendment matter, that someone could still make, well, they applied all the relevant factors, but I still think it's disproportionate?

But let me ask you this: If all the procedures, as Justice Kavanaugh said, were applied perfectly, what is the standard of review? Is it, well, the standard is grossly proportional because the defendant is not permanently incorrigible?

You're supposed to deliver it to the trustee, unless it falls within the exceptions. I don't think you're a life insurance company. I don't I don't know what the exception would be. And now you said: Oh, that's right. So but then the question here is whether the section before that, which says it's a stay, without saying what you do with it, says that you you exercise control over the car, and stay means you ought to turn it over.

So suppose that a city's general practice is keep a car's like the cars at issue here in a basically unguarded lot in a remote location so that there isn't very much preventing somebody who whose car is there from entering and driving off with it. But, when the City hears about a particular case and thinks that it's a let's say it's a particularly valuable car and thinks that there's a real danger that the owner is going to do just that, go go there and drive off with the car, the City relocates that car to a different location where it's subject to 24-hour guard.

As I understand it, adversary proceedings take several months. And to what end? Meaning you would go to court and say, I have a lien. They should give me security. You could do that now even if you had to turn over the car immediately. How can we ensure that these processes would go fast enough to save the debtor from not being able to rehabilitate?

But I'm really wondering about the premise here. I mean, keeping the status quo in place, that's not in the statutory language. It is something that the Court has said multiple times, and mostly it makes complete sense. But I I I wonder whether you're confusing a means and an end, that the real function of an automatic stay is to consolidate the estate so that it can be redistributed. Now, in most cases, consolidating of the estate is going to mean keeping the status quo in place. But, in this unusual circumstance, consolidating the estate means changing the status quo, and and and we should understand the Bankruptcy Code to accept that where that change is necessary to consolidate the estate.

If the goal of bankruptcy is fresh start, according to this brief, Chicago's system is is thwarting that, making the Northern District of Illinois a leader in the country in non-business Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings because of what Chicago's doing.

The the creditor is not going to be liable for any sanctions if he doesn't know about the bankruptcy. And if he does, at that point, he's under obligations to to turn over the property. He's got protections, as you just said, under 542. But the Respondent says that he can also get protections under I guess it's 363.

1841,19-357,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3508.07,3529," It makes a difference according to your argument, it makes a difference in the relative rights of creditors and debtors, and I don't know which is better as a policy argument, but your I don't see how you can have it both ways. Either it's important or it's not important, and, if it's important, then you have to explain why Congress would have chosen to do it in this very oblique fashion.

1842,19-357,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3562.35,3593.54," Counsel, where in 362(a)(3) do you see a requirement that the debtor has to turn it over only upon request? I thought, under the terms of the automatic stay, the minute the Bankruptcy Code is filed the bankruptcy proceeding is filed, the automatic stay requires immediate turnover in other situations without demand. Where do you get demand?
",-1.815825343132019
1843,19-357,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3632.46,3660.65," counsel, if I might interrupt, you're reading something into the provision. Why isn't it more natural to read 542 as controlling when there's been no active exercise of control and that makes a debtor's request the acting principle? Under 542(a), the trustee has to ask for the property. We don't have to make anything up. It's right there.

1844,19-357,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3677.89,3714.4," Counsel, getting outside the legal arguments, on a practical level, what would have to be done and I know we wouldn't do it, Congress would or whatever appropriate bankruptcy committee would what would have to be done to expedite this proceeding for things like cars in a way that doesn't give you everything you want but provides a reasonable opportunity for a debtor for a creditor like the City to come in and ask for adequate assurances of protection?

1845,19-357,Elena_Kagan_,3760.08,3787.71," Mr. Wedoff, the City of Chicago here and the SG, too, argues that the only thing that the automatic stay provision is about is maintaining the status quo. So I just thought I'd ask, is there is there any other circumstance in which the automatic stay provision compels an action that alters the status quo, or is is is is this one the only one in your view?
",-0.9060168862342834
1846,19-357,Elena_Kagan_,3859.835,3882.01," And and how about this? I I take it that your argument is essentially that 362(a)(3) becomes the enforcement mechanism for the 542 provisions. But is there another example like that where the automatic stay enforces an obligation that's imposed by another different provision of the Bankruptcy Code?
",-1.4754427671432495
1847,19-357,Elena_Kagan_,3899.075,3932.88," And if it if if if you are right that the automatic stay is an enforcement mechanism, wouldn't we expect the two provisions, 362 and 542, to be completely the same in scope? But, as Ms. Sinzdak pointed out, they're they're really not. There's the exception for things of minimal value in 542. There are some other exceptions. So they're not coterminous. If one were really enforcing the other, shouldn't they be?

And Justice Alito, I think, asked before, you know, do we have to decide those questions? So a similar question to you: Does your argument really depend on a particular view of what 542 says and how it operates, or could we, for example, take Chicago's view and you would still win?

1849,19-357,Neil_Gorsuch_,4045.55,4072.555," In '84, they added the ""or exercise control"" provision. And isn't there some linguistic gap in there? For better or worse, Congress never talked about just retaining possession, it didn't speak about keeping possession, it didn't speak about anything else about possession. It went on to add new and different language about exercising control. What do we do about that?

I'd also like you to address the point that nobody seems to think that it it would be acceptable for the City to just simply abandon these cars and that, in fact, as I understand it, your position is that on request or at least on request, maybe automatically, the City must hand over the car to the trustee. But where do we get that in 362? Nothing speaks to handing anything over. It just is a stay, as as Judge McKay put it on the Tenth Circuit. It's a stay, not a go provision. What do we do about that with that?

The point is you want to use this as as a self-executing requirement to hand things over, not merely abandon the property.

Just to follow up on Justice Gorsuch's questions at the beginning of the colloquy with him, the 1984 amendment, he made the point, and I think you agree, that, obviously, would have been simple enough to put ""retain possession"" in there or ""keep possession,"" as Justice Gorsuch said. Is your point that ""exercise control"" covers that and covers other things? Is that the nature of your response to him? I just want to make sure I have that nailed down textually.

If you were to lose this case, what would be the effect in your view on day-to-day bankruptcy practice in bankruptcy courts?

1854,19-357,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4498.015,4541.895," Counsel, I'm sorry, this is Justice Sotomayor. I don't understand that last point. If a turnover provision under 542 is would result in the debtor coming in and saying, I need the property to earn a living, under 542, you can come in and say: I need security or raise any other sorts of defenses that would delay the proceedings. You get to keep the property and deprive the other creditors of any possibility of recovery. So isn't the gamesmanship the problem here? Who's going to suffer the loss?

And why why isn't the decision here EPA's final rule on the cooling water intake structures, and the Services' opinion simply is predecisional from the perspective of that final rule?

I mean, you talk about, within an agency, the different steps in the process, and you say: Well, none of those steps is actually, you know, final and decisional. But, here, all of a sudden you get to the end of the Services' role and it's final and not predecisional, even though it's just part of another ongoing process. In other words, I'm not sure that your position doesn't prove too much.

",-1.6880583763122559
1858,19-547,Clarence_Thomas_,377.035,408.2," So what if you were right I'm trying to figure out, like, if you're right up to the line that there is there is no more deliberation, that let's say it's there's it's a final, final draft and you simply are call calling EPA to give a heads-up that you're about to send it in in five minutes. Would you make the same argument? Anything short of actually sending it, that's what I'm getting at.

1859,19-547,Stephen_G_Breyer_,486.1,573.17," Well, I'm not one, I'd like any comment you have about the test. I mean, the object is will this document, in fact, diminish agency decisionmaking quality by by discouraging the staff and others from debating if it's going to become public? And you might have a better choice or not, I'm curious, about the the words that have been used are predecisional and deliberative. Hmm, maybe. Okay. So that's one in the back of my mind. Anything you want to say? And the other thing, at least in some of these documents, and we'll have to look through the record, it it seems to have reached a final stage. I mean, people say, when you make these final changes, which they made to the draft, I can e-mail the Assistant Director, and we have an autopen with his signature we can use to send it out, and they'll send it to the EPA. And, in fact, that's what they normally do. I mean, normally what they do is they send these things over before they're absolutely final. The EPA makes changes. And then it never appears. And that happened apparently thousands of times, and only twice did they actually publish it. So so those those those are do you get what I'm driving at? And, if so, I'd appreciate your your thoughts.

1860,19-547,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,746.17,780.58," Well, if it if it almost never occurs, then something that is labeled a draft biological opinion may really be tantamount to the Services' final word on the subject, unless it can be persuaded by the action agency to change its opinion or the action agency makes an adjustment in what it was previously proposing to do. Isn't that the case?
",-0.3946680724620819
1861,19-547,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,799.545,842.19," Okay. Well, maybe that's maybe that's true, but I'm interested in where your argument goes, where we should draw the line. Do you want us to draw a line between those draft biological opinions that do not reflect that reflect all of the deliberation that the Service intends to conduct internally, but and those that do not reflect all of the deliberation that the Service wants to conduct internally, or does your argument logically lead to the conclusion that no draft biological opinion can ever be final?
",-0.2625686824321747
1862,19-547,Sonia_Sotomayor_,892.11,993.8," I am following up a little bit on Justice Alito's questioning. In Bennett, we held that biological opinions, while technically advisory, have ""a powerful coercive effect"" on the action of the agency. Why is it that a draft jeopardy opinion doesn't have the same coercive effect? As I think the Ninth Circuit pointed out, what was at issue was the November rule that the EPA was proposing, and the draft that was sent to the EPA made them change their mind. They did something completely different. With respect to the decision relating to that November action, the draft opinion did exactly what a final opinion is intended to do. So I I understand your basic argument that it wasn't clear the agency's final decisionmaker had accepted that that was the jeopardy opinion they were going to get, but I go back to Justice Thomas's question. If that agency head was about to sign it and said, ah, I'll I'm just going to send it to them and tell them I'll sign it on on Monday, I don't want to go into the office on Sunday, it would be your argument that that wouldn't be a final opinion worthy of disclosure?

1863,19-547,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1041.155,1060.26999995," Counsel, I have one question I want to get to. In the Ninth Circuit, you agreed that a remand would be appropriate to determine whether the documents contain segregable factual information. Do you think that if we were to rule in your favor, we would still have to remand for that to happen?

1864,19-547,Elena_Kagan_,1106.575,1162.605," Mr. Guarnieri, could I focus on the part of your argument which is that the relevant decisionmakers were still working on the draft and give you a hypothetical, which is that there was the draft came to the relevant decisionmakers, and he looked at it and he realized that it was going to cause a big problem for the EPA, and so he said: You know, I'm not going to send this over. I'm going to give the EPA head a call and just tell him everything in it, and that will ensure that there's nothing FOIA-able that in this document. What what would your answer to that be? You know, he has the document, he's not working on it, but but he doesn't want to make it FOIA-able. And can he end-run this in that way?

Because one way to understand what happened here is that everybody really responded and acted as if there were a completed draft opinion. You know, there was sending the reasonable alternatives over. The AP the EPA starts talking to the Service about how to change its rule. The EPA does change its rule. It was as if you know, everything that happened was as if there had been a final draft opinion that was sent to the EPA.

Let's say EPA had decided at the end of it to just withdraw its rule and and give up, at least for the time being, maybe come back to it in five or 10 years. Would that be a final decision?

Just to follow up on the Chief's questions and Justice Gorsuch's questions, it's possible, I think, in your view, that even a final agency or opinion or memo could still be predecisional as part of a broader deliberative process, and a draft opinion, which we have in this case, in your view, is even more obviously predecisional. Is that correct in terms of a general statement?

1870,19-547,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1674.53,1688.685," Well, if I could interrupt, I I understand that point as to this case, but how we frame the rule or the principle will matter. And how exactly would you have us frame the principle of law that governs here?

1871,19-547,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1739.59,1761.965," I want to pick up on the thread that Justice Kavanaugh was just exploring with you. You said that if a government official simply stamps ""draft"" on it and sent it over and, as Justice Kavanaugh is positing, did so in order to avoid FOIA disclosure requirements, you said that a court might look at other factors to determine whether it's still final. What other factors would a court consider?
",-1.120192527770996
1872,19-547,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1835.925,1854.105," That's a pretty fact-intensive determination then. So it's not your position that we should adopt some sort of bright line saying, listen, it's not over until it's over, it's not until it's actually issued in the sense of being final, maybe even in the Bennett versus Spear sense of the word? You're not asking for a rule that's that bright?
",0.6320763230323792
1873,19-547,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1892.56,1914.9," So your first order of preference would be the kind of formalistic line that I was just describing, and then your backup argument would be, if the Court was uncomfortable about the possibility of avoiding FOIA obligations by, say, the stamping ""draft"" on the top, that we go with the more kind of multi-factor fact-specific test, you know, maybe to see was the agency holding this out as a final opinion?
",-0.8518384695053101
1874,19-547,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2108.09,2154.495," Counsel, government decisionmaking often involves several different layers, you know, the issues addressed by the section and then it turns over to the bureau, then it goes to the division, and, eventually, say, to the final decisionmaker. What what if that decisionmaker, looking at all this, says, you know, I think I think the bureau got it right; I don't think the division did much at all; I like what they did? Does that mean in other words: And that's why I'm making the decision I am, because I think the bureau analysis was right.

We asked the government how close to the line of actually sending the proposal out or the rule out would he would he can he come to before it ceases being a draft. I'd like to ask you, how far back in the process can we go before it is not discoverable and it's a part of the deliberative process, as opposed to something that is subject to FOIA?

",-0.3157106637954712
1880,19-547,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2547.075,2605.55," Okay. In the history of this Act, that document, once they publish it, will force EPA to change, basically, and that document has been actually issued never. I mean, let me not exaggerate. In 7,000 cases in seven years, they issued one exactly twice. Now the reason is there is a different document called a draft biological opinion, and what happens when they write that draft is they send it to EPA and they negotiate, and EPA eventually ends up probably doing what they finally agree to do. So we're talking about that draft biological opinion, and it has two things about it: One, we're going to negotiate this with EPA; and, two, private people, who are nothing to do with the EPA, can get a hold under FOIA of that document. Is that right?
",-0.14864666759967804
1881,19-547,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2612.69,2624.94," Yeah. All right. What happens next, but there is a document called draft biological thing, and things happen as a result of that, and it's pretty clear that private people can get ahold of it. Indeed, there's a reg to that effect. Is that right?

1882,19-547,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2628.97,2652.08," An applicant can get ahold of it. So I thought that that was, once you write that draft biological opinion, you've got something that's final enough that somebody can get it under FOIA. Now the question here is: Well, what about the draft leading up to that draft? And that's what we're trying to get or not get. Is that right?

And so the government says: Well, this is just a draft of the draft, or maybe the government means, no, you can't get ahold of the draft, in which case you can never get ahold of anything because they never use anything beyond the draft.

So your view is I looked through the nine or the the documents that are supposed to be turned over or not, I read this record, and I ask myself: Is this, in effect, the draft biological opinion, or is this a document that is part of the debate within the agency that will lead up to the draft biological opinion that will serve as a basis for the discussion with EPA?

The other is to try to draw a distinction between different kinds of drafts. So let me ask you this: Suppose that the Services went through a three-step process in issuing a biological opinion, and the draft produced at Step 1 turns out to be what the Service will ultimately issue 90 percent of the time. What emerges from Step 2 is what it will issue 97 percent of the time. And what emerges from Step 3 is the final product. Now at what point do you think a document would become non-privileged?

In this case, what is clear is that all we know is that portions of the draft jeopardy opinion went to the EPA. And I know that or at least my law clerk has looked through the record and not been able to find an answer as to what portions. But how can we say that there was a final draft jeopardy opinion that was signed off if the EPA never saw it?

1890,19-547,Elena_Kagan_,3242.22,3284.775," Well, suppose that suppose that the the the the Service head got a memo from a staffer saying this is this is a bad idea, there's going to be all kinds of jeopardy, and the Service head really had not did did not look at it very closely, you know, hadn't decided whether he was ready to sign off on it, but he did realize that there were some issues here, and he calls up the EPA and he says: Look, I I haven't gotten all the way through this, I haven't made a final decision yet, but I I I think that there might be a problem here, and I want to get you to talk to my guys and to try to work this out informally. Would would you say that there's a FOIA-able document there?

1891,19-547,Elena_Kagan_,3301.03,3333.555," Well, I guess why isn't my hypothetical essentially this case? If we if we treat declarations as as serious and as worthy of, you know, being you know, we should respect them unless we see something to the contrary, that basically the head of the Service looked at this and said: I don't know if I'm ready to sign off on this. I think maybe more work would need to be done to put this in final form. I think that there's probably a a an issue here. I want to get everybody to start talking about it.

1892,19-547,Neil_Gorsuch_,3350.54,3406.345," Good morning, counsel. I I think we all understand the problem of of the government effectively stamping everything ""draft"" and and and the concerns that attach to that. But I just wanted to explore the concerns on the other side of the coin too, and that is, you know, without adequate room to kind of back down privately, the government sometimes winds up making worse decisions rather than better ones. And, here, it does seem like that because of the back and forth privately, thanks to the Services' intervention, EPA came up with a a rule that might be better from your perspective. To what what how do we balance that concern and allow agencies sufficient room to maneuver privately to avoid having, you know, to embarrass themselves later and allow them to save face to get to better policy results?

1893,19-547,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3537.695,3586.025," Thank you Mr. Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Narayan. I wanted to pick up first on Justice Thomas and Breyer and Alito and and others have talked about. What is the agency decision? I would I would have thought that the way to do this is to start by figuring out what is the decision, capital D decision, and then everything that led up to that decision is is predecisional. And that would be a pretty simple formula. And, obviously, there would be case questions in some cases about what the decision is. Here, theoretically, you could argue EPA's decision, but the government acknowledges that the Services' opinions are the decision. What's wrong with that framework?
",-0.3363569676876068
1894,19-547,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3603.36000005,3669.35," And the second question I wanted to ask is the need for clear rules in the FOIA context. So the the need for that, I think, is multi-pronged. First, the agency officials who are engaged in deliberations need to be able to speak with candor, as Justice Gorsuch was just saying. Second, FOIA officers, who are rampant throughout the executive branch, spend an enormous amount of time and resources on FOIA, could use clarity. And then district court judges in the District of Columbia and elsewhere, if you talk to, would lament the lack of clarity and clear rules in in FOIA cases. So that raises the concern that the effects-based test or looking at the effects of the memo could become so fact-intensive and could really blur the longstanding predecisional principle of the deliberative process privilege because lots of drafts have have real effects within the executive branch. Can you respond to all that?

1895,19-547,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3758.465,3791.58," Counsel, I have a question following up on Justice Breyer when he gave you the hierarchy of documents that might be at stake here. I want to be sure that I understand the consequences that flow from each. So, you know, in your conversation with Justice Breyer, you identified the biological opinion, which is almost never issued; the draft biological opinion, which is available by regulation; and then the draft of a draft, which the government says this was. Is it true that the draft biological opinion, that second one in the hierarchy, is always FOIA-able and that there's no controversy about that?
",-0.8560786247253418
1896,19-547,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3813.34,3835.955," Okay. Thank you. I wanted to clarify that. My next question has to do with the what you characterized as the legal effect of this document. Why was it a legal effect as opposed to simply a practical effect when having this document caused the EPA to abandon the 2013 regulation and then move on to the 2014 regulation?
",-1.0741585493087769
1897,19-547,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3866.62,3896.3," But I'm sorry, counsel, let me just interrupt for one second. I think that's true if you have a final biological opinion. But, in this case, would you say that if EPA simply got I'm sorry if EPA simply got wind of what the Services were thinking and said: Oh, well, it doesn't look like this is going to be on a a good track for us with respect to jeopardy, and so abandoned it, that seems to be a practical consequence, and that might be the same kind of consequence that flows from a draft opinion, as opposed to a biological opinion, which does have force in the scheme.

1898,19-963,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,127.525,185.84," Thank you, counsel. When you look at the pertinent clause at issue here, one thing that's clear is that they did not want actions seeking injunctive relief to be arbitrated. They they say that expressly right at the outset. As soon as they say any dispute, they have the carveout right there. So they didn't want arbitrators dealing with actions seeking injunctive relief. Now, if that's the case and it was important enough for for them to spell it out right at the outset, wouldn't the last thing you'd think they would want is for an arbitrator to decide which disputes qualify? I mean, that would seem to follow a fortiori. They don't want arbitrators deciding this. Why would they want arbitrators to decide who gets to decide it?

1900,19-963,Clarence_Thomas_,314.52,341.245," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Shanmugam, the it sounds as though you think this is that the delegation of arbitrability is is all or nothing. How would you draft this provision so that it can divide the ability to the authority to arbitrate?

1901,19-963,Clarence_Thomas_,410.56500005,434.315," Could you just give me help me with the delegation language in this contract, this arbitration agreement. Where is it? I don't see the word ""delegation"" at all or a verb ""delegate"" at all. Would you walk me through that?

1902,19-963,Stephen_G_Breyer_,502.07,530.27," The experience of arbitration in the labor area for this question, I assume that George Burton's brief makes a big argument about the AAA, and but I won't accept that for purposes of this question. Assume there is clear and unmistakable evidence of delegating the arbitration matter to the arbitrator in general, okay? You've got the assumption?
",-0.5230497717857361
1903,19-963,Stephen_G_Breyer_,530.92,673.23," Now I also think that First Options rests heavily and basically repeats AT&T, so I've read AT&T about five times. What it seems to say is, if you have a question, parties, or one of them, whether this dispute falls under the terms of the contract that have arbitration for 1 paragraphs 1 through 7 or is rather a Section 10 dispute, where there is no arbitration clearly, you don't know if it's a Section 8 or a Section 10, well, what happens? What AT&T says is, but that is a question of arbitrability. It is a question whether this dispute is arbitrable. So it's for the judge. But where there is an arbitration clause in the contract, as there was in First Options as far as the owners knew, but where there is a where there is an arbitration clause, then there is a presumption of arbitrability. All right? So that seems to me, Judge, you decide. You decide whether this particular dispute is sent to an arbitrator or or for the court, i.e., is it arbitrable, you decide, Judge, but if there's an arbitration clause in the contract, you decide with the presumption of arbitrability that it will normally be arbitrable. That's what it seems to say. And so the judge was right to decide it below, but he didn't decide it right because he should have given it a presumption of arbitrability. Now that's how I read those two cases, but also in the back of my mind is what in heaven's name happens in labor arbitration. In the ordinary labor arbitration case and that's where all this law comes from where one party, the labor union, says this is a Section 8 agreement, arbitrate it. No, says the employer. It is a Section 10 kind of situation grievance and, therefore, it falls within the exception, don't arbitrate it. How do they decide that? The scope you see, that's like the scope of the of the arbitration clause in the in in the agreement. Do do you see what did you follow that?
",-0.05808727815747261
1904,19-963,Stephen_G_Breyer_,740.64,753.86," where have you got the precedent for that? Because, when I read the five paragraphs in on in AT&T, it seemed to say, yes, that's the rule you apply, but the judge should apply it because it's a question of arbitrability.
",-0.3117203414440155
1905,19-963,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,762.79,798.275," Oh, what do you understand to be the basis for the presumption of arbitrability? It was recognized, I think, the first time in Moses Cohen, and the Court said that it was based on the federal policy favoring arbitration, and it cited Section 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act. But the Federal Arbitration, Section 2, we have also said, requires equal treatment of arbitration contracts and other contracts. So what what is the basis for saying that there is this federal policy that produces the presumption that you rely on?
",-1.1282223463058472
1906,19-963,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,869.82,935.72," Okay. And very, very quickly, I have basically the same question as the Chief Justice. This case comes to us in a rather artificial posture, so we're required to assume that the contract incorporates that the contract provides for the arbitration of the who decides question across the board. And, of course, if that's true, then the answer to the question that we're supposed to decide is foreordained, but if we put but isn't that artificial? When you have a carveout and the parties have taken pains to say this subject, we don't want the arbitrator to have anything to do with this subject, we want the judge to decide this because the judge we want this is something that needs to be decided in accordance with the law, and we know that arbitrators have a lot more leeway in interpreting in interpreting contracts. Isn't that relevant to the question of the scope of the of the delegation of the the power to decide who decides?

1907,19-963,Sonia_Sotomayor_,966.235,1010.61," Counsel, you make much of the fact that we didn't grant cert on the cross-petition. But, in your opposition to the cross-petition and even in your reply on the merits, you say we can reach the issue. In fact, you admitted in your cross-petition that we could affirm on alternative grounds and that it was incorporated and you encouraged us not to grant it. So I don't understand how you can tell us that we have to assume there was a clear delegation of both the exception and all other disputes. So sort of educate me as to, having said we could, why you're saying we can't now.
",0.5271313786506653
1908,19-963,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1049.21,1119.485," All right. May I just ask a question? First Option makes it very clear that we have to have a clear delegation. But I think what the court below said was what is unclear is whether the form of the delegation here was intended to be included in that arbitrability section. There's a very limited holding saying where a party says I will I will arbitrate all disputes except a particular one, the issue is whether a particular one was delegated to the arbitrator in the following arbitration agreement. It seems pretty logical, not a a not an argument that the court below adopted. It doesn't seem to be irrational or even nonsensical. It seems it seems fairly natural to me.
",0.7249763607978821
1909,19-963,Elena_Kagan_,1154.735,1175.06," Mr. Shanmugam, you acknowledged, I think to the Chief Justice, that however likely or unlikely you think it might be, however logically flawed or completely natural you think it might be, that parties can divide up arbitrability questions and give some to judges and some to arbitrators. Is that right?
",-0.7947335839271545
1910,19-963,Elena_Kagan_,1178.67,1209.955," So let's assume that the following: Let's assume a provision that says except for actions seeking injunctive relief, we, the parties, agree that we'll, number one, arbitrate any dispute arising under this agreement and, number two, that the arbitrator will decide all questions of arbitrability. Now wouldn't it be clear on its face of that that the parties had given questions of arbitrability to the courts in actions seeking injunctive relief?
",-0.9113138318061829
1911,19-963,Elena_Kagan_,1216.125,1240.6," I don't think I've modified the provision at all. I mean, I basically turned the reference to the AAA rules into a delegation, which is what you want me to do. And then I suggested that the reading of this provision that the ""except"" clause applies both to the agreement to arbitrate disputes and to the delegation.

1912,19-963,Elena_Kagan_,1279.46,1306.96," Well, Mr. Shanmugam, I think it's not absurd for exactly the reason that the Chief Justice said, that once you decide that certain questions should be in the court, here, you know, suits involving that certain suits should be in the court, here suits seeking injunctive relief, you're not going to want to go to the arbitrator to decide whether suits plausibly seeking injunctive relief are, in fact, that. You would just want to keep this in the courts generally.

1913,19-963,Elena_Kagan_,1307.38,1323.335," So there's nothing unnatural or logically flawed to say, look, if you have something which at least arguably seeks injunctive relief, the court should deal with the question of whether it does and then should go on to decide the issue.

1914,19-963,Neil_Gorsuch_,1353.145,1396.085," Mr. Shanmugam, I'd like to return to the line of questions Justice Alito was pursuing, and that is the the presumption in favor of arbitration and the exception for clear and unmistakable delegations of arbitrability. These presumptions that we've recognized in our case law you indicated had both a statutory and a common law basis. I'm I I I want to understand your statutory argument better because, for the moment, assume I'm I'm going to put the common law ones aside. You pointed us to Section 2, but Section 2 seems to suggest we follow normal contract rules in trying to discern the parties' intentions. What am I missing?

The premise of the case as you're presenting it to us is that this contract language expressly delegates the question of arbitrability to the arbitrator, correct?
",-1.3840876817703247
1917,19-963,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1550.54,1565.645," Yeah, by incorporation. And you you say if we want to figure out whether the AAA rules actually are an express delegation, we should grant cert on that question at some point and decide that, but, for here, we can assume express delegation, correct?
",-1.3353633880615234
1918,19-963,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1566.59,1584.405," Okay. And then your point is that the Fifth Circuit I think this is your argument confused the question of of arbitrability, namely, what subjects are decided by an arbitrator and what subjects are decided by a court confused that question with the question of who decides arbitrability, is that right?
",-1.0086203813552856
1919,19-963,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1586.15,1619.65," Okay. And then, in the real world I want to pick up on some of Justice Kagan's questions kind of real-world, how people draft these contracts, what they expect, my understanding was that the question of who decides arbitrability, the who decides question, is almost never divided between a court and an arbitrator because that would be almost nonsensical in the real world because you need one person to decide, and it's either going to be the court or the arbitrator, not both the court and the arbitrator. Is that correct?
",-0.5904083251953125
1920,19-963,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1624.36,1666.9," Right. Nor am I. Okay. And then, in considering the effect of a carveout, I guess that would apply, as as I understand it, to every arbitration contract or virtually every arbitration contract because every arbitration contract specifies either limits or has carveouts. And so, if that alone means the Court decides what is arbitrable, then the Court will always decide arbitrability and really eradicate the idea that arbitrators can ever decide arbitrability. Is that accurate, or am I missing something?
",0.11393826454877853
1921,19-963,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1698.49,1722.47," I think this picks up on maybe the premise of the Chief Justice's question. What if the arbitrator does something crazy and says, actually, a clause for injunctive relief doesn't mean what it says or a carveout for injunctive relief doesn't mean what it says and I'm going to have an injunctive claim decided by the arbitrator? What happens then?

1922,19-963,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1745.375,1824.015," Mr. Shanmugam, I really just have one question and it goes to the the premise of your argument, which is that there was a clear and unmistakable delegation of all questions of arbitrability in the first place, because, you know, basically, as I understand it, your argument is, given that clear and unmistakable delegation, the presumption was flipped, and so the Fifth Circuit was wrong to read this carveout as a carveout from arbitrability as well as to the the what in the subject matter of the dispute. Let's say that we're not going to address the question on which we denied cert, which is, you know, whether reference to the AAA rules suffices to be that clear and unmistakable arbitrability delegation of arbitrability. Here, as you point out, this carveout, you you say that it would be nonsensical even though parties can do it because they can contract and agree to what they want to, that it would be nonsense nonsensical to carve up arbitrability questions. If that's true, why isn't that reason to interpret this clause as not being a clear and unmistakable delegation of all questions of arbitrability? I mean, is just the invocation of the AAA rules enough given the inclusion of what you say would be a pretty odd pretty odd language?

1924,19-963,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2125.96,2190.87499995," Counsel, I think the most important question for you, it's a challenge that your your friend on the other side has really laid down clearly and was the one that Justice Kavanaugh was was talking about. How do you distinguish a situation we call the run-of-the-mill situation where there is no express carveout? Just say that the agreement applies to all labor disputes it within in the factory, and there's a storage facility right next door where they keep things that are used in the factory, but they also keep other stuff, and the union says we want to arbitrate a dispute about that building, and the factory owner comes in and says, no, no, that's not within the arbitration agreement, that's not part of the fact of the factory. Now why doesn't isn't that analyzed the same way you analyze your contract and say, well, that's a question of arbitrability, and that should be decided by a court? What makes that situation different?

1925,19-963,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2209.99,2243.96," I I wish you'd just leave the AAA rules out of it. I think that's what we tried to do when we denied cert on that question. It it it's just I mean, the argument on the other side is that the issue that you're trying to elevate outside the normal situation comes up all the time, because arbitrators are always deciding whether something is within the scope of of arbitration or not and that that issue has never been treated as a question of who decides. But why is your case different?
",0.43894630670547485
1926,19-963,Clarence_Thomas_,2331.33,2353.23," Well, let's just take the AAA. Of course, we're not arguing about that, but basically the same thing, except that you use the term ""expressly"" dealt expressly delegates the authority to the arbitrator pursuant to the rules set out in AAA.
",-0.26692283153533936
1927,19-963,Clarence_Thomas_,2431.265,2452.95," So, if I understand you then, you your argument is that well, who determines that? Would that then be the court? So you you would actually say that with respect to the carveout, the court makes the determination. Well, it seems to me you're taking it away from the arbitrator then.
",-0.7010940909385681
1928,19-963,Clarence_Thomas_,2485.84,2512.35," Well, it's still it seems it it's a limitation on the authority of the arbitrator who in our which seems to be that normally the arbitrator would determine arbitrability arbitrability. And, here, you're taking it away. So I see what the rub is. I don't know how you can have it both ways. You can say he has the authority, and in these limited circumstances, he doesn't.

1930,19-963,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2569.285,2591.4," Now let's assume the Chief Justice's example that, if, in fact, there were a clause in the arbitration clause which says we delegate gateway matters to the arbitrator, it would be the arbitrator who decided whether his second warehouse fell within or outside the clause, right?
",-1.4906277656555176
1931,19-963,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2612.5,2709.515," Now what he's saying is, your friend on the other side, look, take a list of 100 disputes between employer and worker. All kinds of things don't go to the arbitrator. Now one thing on that list of 100 is who should decide the gateway matter of arbitrability. And we have in this contract, it is a there is a it is a contract that contains an arbitration clause and that arbitration clause deals with gateway matters, and it sends them to the arbitrator. So precisely the same way that we would tell an arbitrator that you decide matters of where you decide the warehouse is or is not, use the presumption of arbitrability. If the whole thing were clear, we should do the same thing here, apply the presumption of arbitrability on the gateway matters because there is a general delegation of question of arbitrability to the arbitrator, a general delegation of the gateway matter to the arbitrator, and Section 4 says I mean the fourth principle of AT&T says where that's so, you use an assumption, a presumption, in favor, in this case, of arbitrability of the gateway matter. Now I think that's what he's saying, but I'm not 100 percent positive. If you understood the question, which I hope I did, what's the answer?

And if we make that assumption, I really don't know how to answer the question that we granted review on, because it does seem to turn on the degree of the delegation to the arbitrator of the power to decide whether the arbitrator can decide. If if I'm required to assume that all of that was delegated to the arbitrator, well, then the answer is clear. If I'm required to assume only that part of it was delegated to the arbitrator, then maybe, under First Options, the answer is is also clear.

I think they say arbitrability disputes shall be submitted to and ruled on by the arbitrator. That seems pretty as direct as you could get.
",0.135355606675148
1935,19-963,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3104.295,3135.175," Okay, because of the exception. Then I did understand you right. I I understand the argument. I'm not sure it gets you where you want to be for all the reasons that my colleagues have said, that where someone clearly has set forth that scope of arbitration, which is the AAA rule, it's up to the arbitrator, then I don't see why we shouldn't honor that explicit request.
",0.7913107872009277
1936,19-963,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3157.75,3211.03," It does it does seem to me that I don't see any way to avoid that your position basically says, as long as that every arbitrability issue has to be decided by the Court, because every single arbitration agreement has limitation. Almost all agreements say any disputes related to this contract are are are subject to arbitration. And almost inevitably, a party will come in and say this dispute is not related to a contract. And what would you have a Court do? Decide that issue and then send it to arbitration, even when a contract says all disputes involving arbitrability go to the arbitrator?
",-0.10198783129453659
1937,19-963,Elena_Kagan_,3234.985,3306.47," Mr. Geyser, I I'd like to ask you about the Petitioner's view of the presumptions here. As I understand it, it goes like this: First, we have a presumption that's in favor of arbitration. Then we have an exception to that presumption, which is the First Options rule. When the matter deals with arbitrability, we actually presume that the Court is supposed to decide those gateway questions. So, for whatever reason, we have those presumptions. The Court has said many times that we have those presumptions. Then, as I understand what the Petitioner is saying, he's saying, now let's add a third presumption. The third presumption is, if we see evidence of any delegation, then we should assume that the parties meant to delegate all arbitrability questions. So, if there's any delegation of arbitrability, there's complete delegation of arbitrability. That's the presumption. And he says that presumption should operate because it wouldn't make sense to do partial delegations of arbitrability. So I would like to hear what your response is to that argument.
",-0.21442162990570068
1938,19-963,Elena_Kagan_,3375.235,3404.61," So, you know, I mean, on its face, it seems as though if you delegate if if you if you say the courts should deal with the existence of a delegation, then the court should also deal with the breadth of the the delegation. But I think he thinks that the problem is, if you give that question to the court, you force the court to decide what is arbitrable before decide before the court decides who gets to decide that issue.

1939,19-963,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3459.14,3577.27," Thank you, Chief Justice. And, Mr. Geyser, good afternoon. First, picking up on Justice Sotomayor's questions on the incorporation of the AAA rules, you that's not the issue before us, but just to pause on that for a second, you referred to it as an elephant in a mouse hole. But it's really an elephant in an elephant hole. When you look at the AAA rules, Rule 7(a) says, ""the arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim."" That's very broad language, which is probably why every court of appeals to address this said that the AAA rules are an express delegation. But, again, we don't have to decide that here. That's just the premise. But I wanted to just pause on the elephant in in a mouse hole point. Here's here's the problem I think I have with your argument, and you've made it very cleverly and persuasively, but the problem is that you are suggesting that the way parties divide up arbitration namely, some subjects will be subject to arbitration and decided by an arbitrator and some subjects won't also applies to the question of who decides arbitrability. So courts will decide whether certain things are arbitrable or not, and arbitrators will decide whether other things are arbitrable. I think that's what you're saying. But that's just not how it works in the real world, nor could it realistically work that way in the real world. I don't think any contract says arbitrability shall be of certain subjects shall be decided by the arbitrator and others of other subjects by the court. Can you help me on that? Am I wrong?
",0.36928457021713257
1940,19-963,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3622.09,3644.03," Well, I think it's just to interrupt, I think what we're trying to figure out, does the carveout apply to what subjects go to arbitration, or does the carveout also apply to who decides arbitrability? And I think, to the extent there's any ambiguity on that, the alleged absurdity seems quite relevant to deciding that question.
",0.11285536736249924
1941,19-963,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3680.06,3723.75," So, counsel, I feel a little bit like Justice Sotomayor. You know, this this case feels like it's a little bit all over the map because you've offered us several different ways to rule in your favor. And I I just want to be sure that I understand your argument. And so the you should take as your premise that we're not addressing the question on which we denied cert in your cross-petition on whether incorporating the AAA rules by reference constitutes a delegation. Is it your argument that, first of all, there is no clear and unmistakable delegation here at all, so you win, or, alternatively, that even if there was a general, clear, and unmistakable delegation, that the carveout provision carved out arbitrability as well as subject matter?
",0.2015482783317566
1942,19-963,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3749.09,3765.61," Okay. So, on the first point and you said to be candid, that most of that argument does turn on the AAA rules, the incorporation of them not constituting a delegation. If we don't address that question, and if we just decide this case assuming that it can be, do you lose on the first point?
",-0.7200000882148743
1943,19-963,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3786.795,3817.005," Okay. I I didn't mean so you're referring to your second way, second route to victory, right? I I'm I'm just asking on the first point, do you lose on your argument that there was no clear and unmistakable delegation at all if we, declining to get into the question that we denied cert on, assume that incorporating the AAA rules by reference is enough to constitute a clear and unmistakable delegation, do you lose on your first argument if that's how we approach it?
",0.05468076467514038
1944,19-963,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3823.76,3843.68," So it's not your position that it's possible to incorporate the AAA rules by reference but still, through the context of the language in the provision, not intend simply by reference by incorporating the AAA rules to clearly and unmistakably delegate? You don't have kind of a halfway position --
",-0.1450096219778061
1945,19-840,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,160.145,175.87," Well, so, if someone who doesn't purchase insurance pursuant to the mandate applies for a job down the road and has to fill out a questionnaire asking whether you've ever violated a law, which which box should he check, yes or no?
",-1.2182308435440063
1946,19-840,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,195.8,239.825," Well, let's say Congress passes a law saying everybody has to mow their lawn once a week, and they even make a lot of findings about why that's a good thing. You know, it makes the country look neater, you get fresh air if you have to do that, it supports the lawn mower business, and but the fine for violating it is zero zero dollars. Do they have standing? I mean, the the neighbors will see that they're not obeying the law. The objectives of Congress will not be fulfilled. In other words, there will certainly be injury to that person, and I wonder why I wonder if, under your theory, that person would not be able to challenge the law.

1947,19-840,Clarence_Thomas_,271.98,314.395," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. General Mongan, if putting the Chief Justice's question in today's terms, I assume that in most places there is no penalty for wearing a face mask or a mask during COVID, but there is some degree of opprobrium if one does not wear it in certain settings. What if someone violates that command? Let's say it's in similar terms to the mandate here but no penalty. Would they have standing to challenge the mandate to wear a mask?
",-0.4986100196838379
1948,19-840,Clarence_Thomas_,385.74,429.555," The the parties here, the Respondents here, really, they're arguing that as we had in the first ACA case, they're arguing that this the mandate, in combination with the other provisions, really caused their injuries. The what is curious here is we have become accustomed to deciding this at the standing stage, and this looks somewhat like a a a a statutory the severability issue looks like a statutory construction matter. So could you explain to me why we would determine severability at the standing stage?

Why can't Texas seek a declaratory judgment that it is not required to calculate eligibility using that method?

1950,19-840,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,717.57499995,743.66," Well, I would ask a related question about what would happen if the IRS attempted to assess penalties on state employers for failing to comply with the reporting requirements in sections 6055 and 6056? In in a collection proceeding, could the state argue that it has no obligation to follow that because they can't be severed from the individual mandate?
",-1.4005608558654785
1951,19-840,Sonia_Sotomayor_,766.79999995,784.615," Counsel, if I understand, and please tell me if I understand your point correctly, which is, if they have claims challenging the provisions that Justice Alito asked about, they should have brought that challenge, not a challenge based on the individual mandate, correct?
",-1.2773960828781128
1952,19-840,Sonia_Sotomayor_,800.15,837.37," Second, counsel, give me your best argument why it would be unreasonable or not legally enforceable for plaintiffs to read the the individual mandate as a legal command. You you answered Justice Roberts' questions in a hypothetical, but I'm asking, are are you accepting that hypothetical or or that assumption not hypothetical, I I used the wrong word assumption, or do you have what's your best argument that it's not a command?
",-0.6546531915664673
1953,19-840,Sonia_Sotomayor_,930.57,954.71," One last question. If I understand your standing argument within the involving the states, but are you arguing that the states are not harmed by the cost of more people enrolling in insurance as a legal matter, or is it that as a factual matter, you think they have not yet demonstrated that they were harmed?
",-1.0446969270706177
1954,19-840,Elena_Kagan_,987.38,1029.665," General, just going continuing on this point of the states' standing, I mean, why wouldn't it be right to say something like, look, you can expect that, as a result of this law, more people will buy insurance, even when there's no enforcement mechanism, just the force of law itself will encourage people to buy insurance, and Texas is now saying, well, that costs us money, it costs us money because of its effect on programs like Medicaid, and it costs us money because we have to send out these forms saying that you bought insurance? I think that those are Texas's two arguments.
",0.7089924812316895
1955,19-840,Elena_Kagan_,1077.615,1100.69," And how about on the individual plaintiffs' side? This is going back to the Chief Justice's questions. I mean, why isn't or why shouldn't the the force of law itself you know, a person can say, if the law says I need to do something, then I have to do something. And we we want citizens to be law-abiding. Why isn't that enough to create standing?

1956,19-840,Neil_Gorsuch_,1136.885,1152.13," Good morning, counsel. Let me pick up where Justice Kagan left off. As I understand it, the United States could still bring a civil action to enforce the mandate under 26 U.S.C. 7402(a). Is that your understanding as well?
",-1.501482605934143
1957,19-840,Neil_Gorsuch_,1238.355,1262.68," And then, with respect to the states, again, picking up on Justice Kagan's point, I I I thought I heard you you agree that the theory of standing that that there's raised costs on enrollment-based injuries or compliance-based injuries could be enough to secure standing; it's just a failure of proof at the summary judgment stage. Is is that is that a fair summary of your position?
",-0.6931701302528381
1958,19-840,Neil_Gorsuch_,1294.815,1319.71," So, if all we need is a substantial risk of a predictable effect of government action on the decisions of individuals, why isn't the Congressional Budget Office report stating that even after the penalty is removed, a small number of people will enroll because of a willingness to comply with the law? And it follows from that that there will be increased costs to the states.

1959,19-840,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1359.12,1405.205," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. And good morning, General Mongan. To pick up on individual standing questions of the Chief Justice and Justices Kagan and Gorsuch, suppose Congress passed a law requiring every American who lives in a house to fly an American flag in front of the house. There's no penalty, and the question then is individual standing. Under Lujan, you're the object of the regulation as a homeowner. It's a forced acquisition of an unwanted good or service. Why isn't that enough to give you standing, knowing that some people are going to do that, buy the flags and fly them, simply because Congress requires that?

1960,19-840,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1485.62,1504.775," On on the point that you mentioned that allowing standing, individual standing, here might open the door, are you aware of any other examples in the U.S. Code at least where Congress has enacted a true mandate, not something hortatory, but a true mandate with no penalties?

1961,19-840,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1511.1,1531.39," No, I take that point. I was just wondering if you were aware of an example. On the merits of the of the claim, under NFIB, obviously, it was justified under the taxing clause, but it now doesn't raise revenue. How do you respond to that point?
",-0.7622339725494385
1962,19-840,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1556.405,1571.265," What should we make of the fact that Congress didn't repeal the provision? I mean, you said earlier repeal, and then you corrected yourself and said zeroed out. I mean, you're asking us to fun treat it as if it functionally has been repealed, but that's not what Congress did. Does that matter?

1963,19-840,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1600.845,1629.5," Let me ask you another question that's related to some of the hypotheticals you've heard some far so far. You know, the Chief asked you about a mandate to mow the lawn, and, you know, Justice Thomas asked you one about forcing people to wear a mask. What if, in this case, you know, and as I understand it to be the case, you have to certify whether you've complied or not and then the government keeps track of that? So the government keeps track of whether you wore a mask or whether you purchased health insurance. Does that change your view of whether there's an injury?
",-0.3315137028694153
1964,19-840,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1691.72,1709.12," Okay, counsel, let me let me just return to the question on the merits. So the states have said these Forms 1095B and C do require as part of taxes for one to certify whether or not one has maintained the minimum coverage necessary. Is that incorrect?
",-1.0508241653442383
1965,19-840,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1871.855,1918.1," Mr. Verrilli, eight years ago, those defending the the mandate emphasized that it was the key to the whole Act. Everything turned on getting money from people forced to buy insurance to cover all the other shortfalls in the expansion of of of healthcare. And the briefs here on the other side go over all that. But but now the representation is that, oh, no, everything's fine without it. Why why the bait and switch? Was was Congress wrong when it said that the mandate was the key to the whole thing, that that we spent spent all that time talking about broccoli for nothing?

1966,19-840,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2002.2,2017.835," General Mongan was asked about whether the burden on the state was enough to support standing, and, of course, he had a little bit of a conflict representing a state, but but you don't. Do you think that that burden is sufficient? The paperwork burden essentially.

1967,19-840,Clarence_Thomas_,2041.3,2095.83," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, the Justice Barrett asked whether or not the just eliminating the penalty the Act wasn't changed, the mandate provisions weren't changed. Just the penalty was eliminated. So was that all that was necessary to eliminate the centrality of this and importance of this provision? Because, when you argued the when this case came up, as the Chief Justice said, some years ago, this provision was the heart and soul of of the Affordable Care Act. And I know the assessment has changed, but the provision hasn't changed, with the exception of the penalty. Could you explain why that penalty provision was so critical to the centrality of this provision?

Since, at the time we heard, when this was first passed, that the mandate was absolutely crucial, as you pointed out, because, unless people buy insurance under this mandate, the other provisions, such as no you you don't have to worry about preexisting conditions, et cetera, won't work. All right. Why isn't that fact --

Mr. Verrilli, this does seem like deja vu all over again, but let me ask you this question about the theory of standing by severability. Suppose there's a very simple statute. It has two provisions, (a) and (b). I'm hurt by (b); I am not hurt by (a). (a) is unconstitutional. The statute has a clause that says if (a) falls, (b) falls too. Under those circumstances, would I lack standing to challenge (a)?
",0.5250421762466431
1970,19-840,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2414.445,2459.735," What you have said about what Congress thought in 2017 perhaps illustrates the difficulty of trying to identify anything that was thought by the majority of Congress other than what it says in a law. A lot of people, a lot of members, in 2017 may well have thought that eliminating the penalty or the tax would not cause any harm and the whole Act could continue to function well without it, but others who voted for it may have done so precisely because they wanted the whole thing to fall. So I don't know what we can make of what was done in 2017 along the lines that you've said.

1971,19-840,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2523.09,2550.745," Counsel, am I assuming your answer to be that, given a choice between or among because there could have been many choices between invalidating and the entire ACA and just zeroing out the tax, that the 2017 Congress's choice was just zero out the tax, correct?
",-1.4026330709457397
1972,19-840,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2567.915,2586.245," And so, if a choice is yet again after NFIB declaring the individual mandate unconstitutional if one sees it as a command, the 2017 Congress has already told us that it doesn't want the rest of the Act to fall, correct?

1973,19-840,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2605.99,2630.83999995," Counsel, there's an intuitive feeling that if the individual mandate is struck down with respect to standing in the states, that they would have less reporting cost because or or less enrollees in their Medicaid and CHIPs program. That's their argument about standing, correct? That --
",-0.7816248536109924
1974,19-840,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2637.48,2657.39," would you address that argument? Your co-counsel for the for the State seems to say there's no evidence that that's true or false.

And I'm pointing specifically at what the plaintiffs in this case sometimes call the inseverability provision, which is a finding, basically, that the mandate was essential to creating effective health insurance markets. And I guess I'm wondering, what do we do about that, the fact that that finding still exists in the law? Does that constrain us in any way?

This Court held that the mandate was a permissible exercise of the taxing authority because it produced revenue, at least some. That seems to have withered away, and we're left with the Commerce Clause and the Necessary and Proper Clause, which the Court foreclosed last time around. Can you help me with that?
",-0.527796745300293
1977,19-840,Neil_Gorsuch_,2971.81,2989.105," let's let's just put that aside for the moment, okay, and and if if we're focusing on the merits and assume the mandate is still something, it's on the books, what are the merits of that under the Commerce Clause?

Assume standing for purposes of these questions, and, on the merits, the mandate as currently structured seems difficult to justify under the taxing clause for the simple reason that it does not raise revenue among others, so it's hard to call it a tax now. And as I think you were just indicating, you can't justify it under the Commerce Clause because five justices in NFIB said you you couldn't. Can you explain your necessary and proper argument just so I have that? You were you were on that.

I tend to agree with you this is a very straightforward case for severability under our precedents, meaning that we would excise the mandate and leave the rest of the Act in place, reading our severability precedents. One of my questions is, do you think that would have been the right result under the 2010 Act, or did that change in 2017, or or how would you assess that?

1980,19-840,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3188.04500005,3212.73," Mr. Verrilli, if the Court construes a statute in a particular way in order to avoid a constitutional question, wouldn't Congress be free to come back and say: No, no, no, that is what we meant, and in this case, for example, we did want to rely on the commerce power? In other words, why would a a an avoidance construction of a statute lock Congress in?
",-0.13675913214683533
1981,19-840,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3278.1,3293.04," But why can't we say that when Congress zeroed out the tax, it was no longer a tax because it generated no revenue, and, therefore, it could no longer be justified as a taxing power, so Congress was presenting it as a mandate which would have to be justified by the Commerce Clause?

The the individual mandate now has no enforcement mechanism, so it's really hard to determine exactly what the threat is of of an action against you. Could you comment on that a bit and and just give us an understanding of what your injury is?
",-1.1236240863800049
1986,19-840,Clarence_Thomas_,3826.93,3852.42," No, that's fine. The I'd like to move to, at what stage would you determine inseverability? The you know, there's a lot of talk that we should consider this at the standing stage, but, when I look at inseverability, I think of it as a statutory construction and something more suitable for the merits stage. But I'd like your comment on that.

1987,19-840,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3882.12,3946.52000005," Turning to the merits, are is your point what do you say about many, many statutes, I suspect, that do have or could have statements do this, don't do that, or do this, and they aren't they do not have any enforcement, they do not have any effect. World War I, defense statutes; buy war bonds. An environmental statute; plant a tree. A one of a thousand statutes commemorating something, beautiful cities day, clean up the yard. I mean, I can recall or I believe just dozens and dozens of statutes where Congress says something where normally we would say it's precatory. Now are all those statutes suddenly open to challenge? I mean, are none of them? If so, you lose. And if it's in between, which ones are and which ones aren't?

1988,19-840,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3952.95,3977.32000005," We're talking on the merits, on the merits. If you have a merits claim, can you suddenly say, this is no good because people will do it? They'll buy war bonds. They will plant a tree. At least one of them will clean up the front yard, okay? And, thereby, I don't know, you see the point. It's a merits point.

1989,19-840,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3992.73,4027.69," I'm sorry, you're missing the point. You're missing the point. On each of them, there is some constitutional argument that if there were a penalty attached, it would be unconstitutional. They take the penalty out from all my examples. Now no penalty. And do you say that they are nonetheless unconstitutional for whatever reason? If so, I think there will be an awful lot of language in an awful lot of statutes that will suddenly be the subject of Court constitutional challenge.

1990,19-840,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4072.225,4095.67500005," General Hawkins, can I ask you, I hope, two quick questions about your theories of standing. First of all, as to increased Medicaid costs because you are required to calculate eligibility based on modified adjusted income, what would happen if you didn't do that?
",-1.4079264402389526
1991,19-840,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,4139.79,4176.39," Okay. As to the reporting requirements in sections 6055 and 6056, the consequences for failure to comply with those, I believe, would be a penalty under the Internal Revenue Code, which this Court has suggested is a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act. So how could that theory of standing survive the limitations imposed by the Anti-Injunction Act?
",-0.5820854306221008
1992,19-840,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4233.44,4330.615," Counsel, I I'd like to understand that a little bit more, your last statement. As I understood the theory you explained earlier of your standing, you say that you assume some people would comply voluntarily with a the legal command at issue here, the individual mandate. As I understand it, the the CB the CBO report predicted that only a small number of people would do that, the exact opposite of what it said in 2009, because of a willingness to comply with law. But you have to take it a step further. You have to prove that those that small number would include people who didn't enroll for Medicaid and didn't enroll for CHIPs when it was a legal requirement as a tax, but they would do so now after they're told there's no penalty for it, there's no tax for it. At some point, common sense seems to me would say: Huh? There's only a small number of people who would do it. That small number of people have to include Medicaid and CHIP recipients to affect you as the state at all. And they would, once they're told there's no tax, enroll now, when they didn't enroll when they thought there was a tax. Does that make any sense to you?
",0.2498956322669983
1993,19-840,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4366.38,4462.195," that your theory assumes that people are going to pay a tax and break the law by not buying insurance, but they wouldn't do it when the tax is zero. That that makes less sense. But moving on from that, on to the substance, okay? In NFIB, we said at least four times by my count that individuals cannot be compelled to buy health insurance under the Commerce Clause. They could only be asked to make a choice under the tax clause. Now the individual plaintiffs here still believe that there's a command, contrary to what NFIB said, that they must buy health insurance. What your only remedy would be to say that provision's unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause and it's unconstitutional under the tax clause. But I don't understand why you're entitled to greater relief when NFIB only says it already says it's unconstitutional. We could say it's unconstitutional now. But you're arguing that somehow us saying it a second time would convince Congress that it could command you to do something we said it couldn't do. Again, does that logic make sense?
",1.0093692541122437
1994,19-840,Elena_Kagan_,4533.345,4576.19000005," Yes, Mr. Hawkins, continuing on on the merits, I I'm not sure I understand the position. In NFIB, we held that the ACAA that the ACA was not an unconstitutional command. So I would think that that has to be the starting point. Now, since then, there has been the change this change, and and and and in this change, where Congress reduces the penalty to zero, Congress has made the law less coercive. So how does it make sense to say that what was not an unconstitutional command before has become an unconstitutional command now, given the far lesser degree of coercive force?
",0.6514948010444641
1995,19-840,Elena_Kagan_,4597.98,4617.895," Excuse me, if I might interrupt, General. I think you have to accept that holding because that holding is what allowed the ACA to remain in existence all this time. I mean, so, however it was, that it was four plus one and what exactly that one said, the holding of the Court was that the ACA was not an unconstitutional command.
",-0.20175333321094513
1996,19-840,Elena_Kagan_,4650.43,4684.81000005," you're just disputing the premise of what we held in NFIB, which has, you know which I I don't think you can dispute, but let me go on. So 5000A(e) says that a class of people and these are mostly poor people, who are subject to the mandate but have those people are subject to the mandate but have never had to pay anything. So do you think that in NFIB, what we really should have concluded was that those people were subject to a command, whereas everyone else had a lawful choice?

1997,19-840,Elena_Kagan_,4706.23,4722.32500005," I mean, doesn't it seem exactly backwards, General, to say that those people who'd never had to pay a thing were subject to a command, when people who did have to pay, who felt the coercive power of government, did not, were not subject to a command?

1998,19-840,Neil_Gorsuch_,4753.38,4789.705," Well, I I'd like to pick up on that, on the merits, Mr. Hawkins. And good morning. As I understood Mr. Verrilli, his argument on the merits is that this is still necessary and proper to the taxing power. And that coercive authority is still in play; it's just that Congress has chosen to set it at zero and wants to the flexibility of retaining that provision in law because it might choose later to increase the tax again. What do you what do you say to that response?
",-0.5285073518753052
1999,19-840,Neil_Gorsuch_,4832.12,4849.88499995," Let let me turn to the remedial question here, and if you could address it with respect to the individual plaintiffs. They've asked for declaratory and injunctive relief. I guess I'm a little unclear who exactly they want me to enjoin and what exactly they want me to enjoin them from doing.
",-1.0242501497268677
2000,19-840,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4940.89,4980.67," Good morning, General Hawkins. Assume for purposes of my questions that there is standing, just assume that. On the merits of the mandate before we get to severability, I want to follow up briefly on Justice Breyer's questions because my understanding might be a little different from his about the existence of other laws. I think, when I asked General Mongan, he agreed with me that there are no examples in the U.S. Code that he's aware of where Congress has enacted a true mandate to do something, to purchase a good or service, not something hortatory, but a true mandate with no penalties. Are is that right?
",-0.18561989068984985
2001,19-840,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4999.84,5049.595," Then, on on severability, if the mandate can't be justified or the mandate as currently structured I'm using that, the term ""mandate"" I understand the arguments from the other side about that term but the mandate as currently structured can't be justified under the Commerce or Taxing or Necessary and Proper Clauses, we get to severability, and looking at our severability precedents, it does seem fairly clear that the proper remedy would be to sever the mandate provision and leave the rest of the Act in place, the provisions regarding preexisting conditions and the rest. So the question to you, obviously, is, how do you get around those precedents on severability, which seem on point here?
",-0.5254976749420166
2002,19-840,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,5077.96,5110.415," If I could just I'm sorry to interrupt, but inseverability clauses usually are very clear, and we did indicate what they look like in AAPC and we cited an example of what they look like, and, you know, Congress knows how to write an inseverability clause, and that is not the language that they chose here. So I I agree with you about focusing on the text, very much agree with that, but I just am having trouble seeing that as the equivalent of an inseverability clause.
",0.6932179927825928
2003,19-840,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5213.92,5248.35," Good morning, General Hawkins. I want to go back to Justice Gorsuch's questions about standing for the individual plaintiffs. So let's say that we agree with you that the mandate, by making them feel a legal compulsion to purchase insurance, has caused them a pocketbook injury. Why is that traceable to the defendants that the individuals have actually sued here? I mean, I can see how it's caused by or traceable to a mandate itself, but how is it traceable, say, to the IRS or to HHS? Why is it their action that's actually inflicting the injury?
",-0.19881312549114227
2004,19-840,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5277.775,5290.66," But but doesn't it really seem that Congress is the one who's injured the individual plaintiffs here, and you can't sue Congress and say: Hey, you've put us under this mandate that's forcing us to buy insurance and that's harming us, right?
",0.5372870564460754
2005,19-840,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5300.9,5334.45," Let me switch gears a minute and talk about state standing. There's some confusion or, I mean, it's my confusion based on differing positions taken in the briefs about these 1095B and C statements. So the House at page 31 of its brief says that the states would have to issue them regardless whether the mandate is intact in the statute or not, but the states point to the cost of producing these you know, these forms and mailing them out as part of what created their pocketbook injury. Who's right?
",-0.16868573427200317
2006,19-840,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,5491.99,5534.285," General, your theory of standing is that a person who's not actually injured by part of the law can challenge that part of the law and, through that, try to strike down other parts of the law that do challenge him or that do injure him. I I think that really expands standing dramatically. I mean, just in this Act alone, you're talking about almost a thousand pages and you're letting somebody not injured by the provision that is challenging to sort of roam around through those thousand pages and pick out whichever ones he wants to wants to attack.
",0.9125149846076965
2007,19-840,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,5581.16,5601.505," No, but it's a common feature it's a common feature of standing that the result is people can't challenge provisions. I mean, it it's an important doctrine. It is the the only reason we have the authority to interpret the Constitution is because we have the responsibility of deciding actual cases, and that's what standing filters out.

2008,19-840,Clarence_Thomas_,5627.47,5657.605," Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. General Wall, I'd like you to discuss at what stage we should confront the inseverability issue. There's much talk that we should do that at the standing stage, but, again, I think, as I've said before, that this it seems more like a statutory construction issue that you consider at the merits stage. Would you comment on that?
",-1.1426122188568115
2009,19-840,Stephen_G_Breyer_,5738.765,5771.7," Yes, I'm going to the merits, and I think I have a I do have a very different understanding than Justice Kavanaugh. What I thought I heard said was that someone in the Solicitor General's Office read through the entire United States Code, which must be quite a job, and discovered that there's no precatory language in the Code. There is nothing in the Code that says something like buy war bonds or something like plant a tree or something like clean your yard. Is that right?
",0.26318076252937317
2010,19-840,Stephen_G_Breyer_,5775.72,5800.97499995," Fine. If you say there is precatory language, ""precatory"" means, in the dictionary, pertaining to entreaty or supplication. Now how is it that you know that this mandate, just by itself, without any penalty, is something more than a supplication or an entreaty?
",-1.04767906665802
2011,19-840,Stephen_G_Breyer_,5855.71,5884.065," I didn't say you weren't aware of any. I might be have a misplaced idea, but I remember when I used to work there, we passed lots of things like National Port Week and all kinds of stuff that was precatory or said let's have a celebration or ""the nation shall,"" but ""plant a tree,"" et cetera. But you have read through the U.S. Code, or someone in your office, and have learned that there is no word ""shall"" in a precatory phrase?
",0.8268210291862488
2012,19-840,Stephen_G_Breyer_,5935.49,5955.765," Well, as you say that, it reminds me in English, have I ever said or have you ever said to someone in your family, you ""shall"" do it, but that is an entreaty, an entreaty or a supplication, rather than threatening a punishment? Have you ever heard that or used ""shall"" in respect to a supplication or an entreaty?

2013,19-840,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,5971.31,5993.84," Perhaps there's a difference between a supplication and a tax. Are you aware of any provisions in the Code in which Congress has purported to use its taxing power to say you must do this and we're going to tax it and we're going to set the tax at zero?

2014,19-840,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,5996.58,6056.48000005," The the what what the feature of this case that has a a strange aspect is the sea change that's occurred in the understanding of the role of the individual mandate between our first Affordable Care Act case and today. At the time of the first case, there was strong reason to believe that the individual mandate was like a part in an airplane that was essential to keep the plane flying so that if that part was taken out, the plane would crash. But now the part has been taken out and the plane has not crashed. So, if we were to decide this case the way you advocate, how would we explain why the individual mandate in its present form is essential to the operation of the Act?
",-0.41323280334472656
2015,19-840,Sonia_Sotomayor_,6184.4,6206.565," All right. Then let me finish, counsel. If Congress had, in the TCJA, provided that the shared-responsibility payment would be zero in 2019 and 2020 and 2021 but would phase back in as of 2022, would that be constitutional?
",-0.983122706413269
2016,19-840,Sonia_Sotomayor_,6224.96,6246.06500005," But all but all that Congress did answer the question to my last hypothetical. If Congress had in the TCJA provided that the shared responsibility would be zero for the first three years but would start up at a certain percentage in 2022, would that be constitutional?
",-0.7574689984321594
2017,19-840,Sonia_Sotomayor_,6254.01,6315.16," All right. So what's the difference between that and a decision often made by Congress that for a certain number of years, whatever fines, penalties, taxes were due from people, they're not going to collect? We've had cases with that where we've I I think we had a case just last year where Congress was going to pay a bonus to soldiers and suspended that bonus for three years and then reapplied it later. What's the difference between that constitutionally? If Congress has the power constitutionally to delay, to extinguish, to restart, why is this any different, that at least two Congresses have chosen to forego the tax but another Congress has the power not to?

2018,19-840,Elena_Kagan_,6419.185,6486.57," Okay. I mean, the United States is usually pretty stingy about standing law, so it did surprise me, in much the way that it surprised the Chief Justice, that you're coming in here with a theory which, to my mind, threatens to kind of explode standing doctrine. I mean and I I guess I want to go back to that because I wasn't sure I understood your answer to the Chief Justice. You know, a lot of legislation now is in these huge packages, I mean, even more than the ACA, that that involve a thousand different subjects, omnibus legislation where it's just everybody pours everything in that they can think of. And it would seem a big deal to say that if you can point to injury with respect to one provision and you can concoct some kind of inseverability argument, then it allows you to challenge anything else in the statute. Isn't that something that the United States should be very worried about, and isn't it something that really cuts against all of our doctrine?

2019,19-840,Elena_Kagan_,6505.26,6535.705," If I could just interrupt for a second, General, I I just don't think that that's right. I mean, I I have to say for myself, I I was this this theory was new to me, and I think it would be new to many people. And it's not so hard to construct some kind I mean, you're you're not all you have to do is to present a theory of severability. You don't have to win on your theory and you know, in order to make this a under your view, a proper Article III claim.

2020,19-840,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,6659.88,6702.225," Good morning, General Wall. Justice Breyer rightly points out that the U.S. Code has a lot of precatory language in it. My understanding matches his on on that point. And to the extent that the mandatory language here might be different and unusual, which was my question earlier, I think his question suggests: Well, why not just construe this language as being similar to those precatory provisions that are strewn about the U.S. Code, which probably is both a standing and merits question as I understood him to be asking. Can you respond to that?
",-0.31746774911880493
2021,19-840,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,6735.91,6789.675," With with respect to the mandate as currently structured, you make a forceful argument that it's not justified under the Commerce or Taxing or Necessary and Proper Clauses, at least as construed in NFIB. But then we go to severability, and I understood your opening comments to say that the findings in the original Act are, in essence, the equivalent of an inseverability clause. I just want to test that for a second. I mean, as you know, we have a strong background presumption of severability, which is reflects a longstanding understanding of how Congress works and our respect for Congress's legislative role under Article I. And it also establishes a clear default rule or fairly clear default rule against which Congress can legislate. Congress knows how to write an inseverability clause, but this language is different from how that usually looks. So I just want to give you an opportunity to respond to that.

Do you think that it's indisputable that NFIB would render such an exercise of the commerce power unconstitutional? And I I'm asking because, you know, there were five justices who thought that, but it wasn't a majority opinion who said it. So do you think there's room for doubt on that score?

Ms. Harris, I understand your argument or your answer to the Chief's question about sandbagging on the back injury versus the leg injury. But let's apply that to a choice of the ALJ, that that the claimant does not like the first ALJ, doesn't object to that ALJ, and then later on, at the Council level or at the court the district court level or the federal court level, then objects to the ALJ.

One is: What ground would we choose among several that you advance to say that you don't have to raise it? If the ground is the structure of the Social Security Administration, I do share the Chief Justice's suggestion that not necessarily new evidence but lawyers are very imaginative. They're very good. You sit in your office and you think up excellent arguments that people actually have never raised before and you bring them all to the district judges. Now why isn't that a problem? You may not want to say anything extra that you haven't already said. If you go on the ground that, well, they couldn't consider this, the ALJs, it was futile because the agency told them they couldn't, didn't the agency tell them that after your clients were involved in their cases?

The the ALJ was appointed by a lower-level official and now has been reappointed along with all the others by the acting commissioner. So is is this ALJ now smarter than he or she was at the time of your hearing? More inclined to be favorable to client to applicants like your client? Can you say that, that that's realistic?

The ALJ who heard them initially takes another look at the record, asks himself or herself, you know, given my new position, having been appointed by the acting commissioner, do I see this any differently?

Nevertheless, at the remedy stage, this Court noted that the relief of a new hearing is usually reserved for someone who makes a timely challenge. If we rule in your favor and remand, would the may the courts below still deny your relief on that ground? Not an exhaustion ground but on on simply that it's not equitable?

Because I wasn't quite sure I I understood your answers to him. I mean, imagine that the claim that your clients failed to raise was not this sort of legal/constitutional claim but really was related to the fact-finding that the ALJ had done, so, for example, a question about the proper conclusion to draw from certain medical evidence in a case, something like that. So would you still say there is there's there's no exhaustion requirement in a in a case of that kind?

Of course, Sims was was a plurality opinion, and the the fifth vote is Justice O'Connor's opinion, which really relies only on the short form that's applicable that was applicable in the Appeals Council, which Justice O'Connor was worried had given claimants the wrong impression and that they would rely on it to their detriment.

So one of the best I mean, Sims is obviously your best argument and its discussion of the distinction between adversarial and non-adversarial proceedings. I'm wondering how unique the Social Security Administration is. I mean, so you point out that it's non-adversarial, it's informal. You know, Sims made those points too.

You you began by saying the Appointments Clause is concerns are are well well-established, but I don't think they're very well-known. You know, it's hard to imagine people sitting in the living room talking about their lives and saying how what important a role the Appointments Clause has played, you know, when they were were were growing up. Isn't the expectation that a claimant would raise an issue under the Appointments Clause, which however important to you know, to us lawyers, it's pretty obscure, in such a setting, where the ALJs themselves view it as a very informal and casual setting?

And I thought I'm not positive, but I thought that there was a pretty well-established exception to the need to exhaust an issue where it is a constitutional issue and maybe another one where it's futile. Well, I mean, here, you have a memo of some kind saying don't even decide this, the ALJs, and maybe that was a well-recognized idea before, they shouldn't decide it, futile, and also constitutional issue, fundamental structure, not within the area of the expertise of the of the ALJ.

And I guess I'm just wondering about that because you told the Court in Sims, I think, that the SSA had the matter of issue exhaustion under review. And and the Court specifically noted in that opinion that, of course, SSA could adopt a regulation.

2047,19-1442,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2744.91,2784.24," Good morning, Mr. Raynor. So I have a question about the adversarial/non-adversarial distinction too. As Justice Kavanaugh just pointed out, that portion of Justice Thomas's opinion did command a majority of the Court. One of the reasons, you know, in an adversarial system, the issue exhaustion requirement makes sense is that both sides have every incentive to raise all the issues that would benefit them. In this kind of proceeding, which is non-adversarial, where a claimant has come to the Social Security Administration and come to the ALJ wanting him to give or her to give the claimant benefits, what incentive does the

2048,19-1442,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2784.24,2808.255," claimant have to say to the ALJ: You know, you actually can't give me benefits and you can't adjudicate this proceeding because your appointment should have been made under the Appointments Clause? Especially when, you know, the claimant's interest is in speed of getting the disability benefits as soon as he or she can. So if you could address that.

2049,19-1442,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2867.77,2885.735," Well, it it also raises the question of why an issue exhaustion requirement makes sense in this non-adversarial context. But let let me put that aside because I do want to ask you, do you agree with Ms. Harris that the only other agencies that this holding might affect would be the VA or the Railroad Retirement Board?

I mean, it's it's it's one thing to expect a a pro se plaintiff not to raise an obscure lawyerly issue like the Appointments Clause, but maybe different under the Due Process Clause? I mean, if it's an issue that, you know, so-and-so told me that I wasn't entitled to these damages or, you know, I had this I never got the letter from the government saying this, but they don't raise that until the district court. I mean, it seems to me that that might be a stronger argument for waiver than the Appointments Clause. Is there is there any basis for for such a sliding scale approach?

2051,19-1442,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3059.025,3081.14500005," Well, but you really need someone in this position to be able to raise the Appoints Appointments Clause concern or or it just isn't raised. I mean, it is certainly designed to protect the separation of powers, which is designed to protect the liberty of all of us. So I think there is prejudice in that respect.
",0.7284205555915833
2052,19-1442,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3130.045,3165.75," Yeah. Counsel, if the only reason for providing relief in a case like this is to provide an incentive for parties to raise Appointments Clause claims, does our case law allow us to draw a distinction between the party who gets to the Supreme Court or perhaps a limited category of parties who are similar and everybody else who might be covered by an eventual holding that a category of appointments was unconstitutional?
",-0.9735490679740906
2053,19-1434,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,124.705,178.855," Mr. Stewart, that was a long list of things that the director can do, but, of course, the one thing that he can't do is just change the decision of the APJ. And the rest of those things deciding whether to rehear, you know, stacking, in a non-pejorative way, the panels, rehearing, you know, guidance on hypothetical facts they all seem to be more or less ways of twisting the arms of the APJs. And so it is sort of direct directly opposite to what the Appointments Clause was designed to do, which is transparency and make it clear who's responsible. Here, you know, the director can pressure the APJ, but, at the end of the day, he can say: Well, that's not my fault. That's what he wanted. Why isn't that true?

All kinds of shapes and sizes in terms of powers, and they suddenly all became officers of the United States. But the majority said, we're not saying they all are. We're just talking about PCAOB. So are these people officers of the United States? Why, is my answer. I'd like a line, if you've ever thought of one, between the statement in PCAOB in the majority, don't worry, they're not all officers of the United States.

Suppose the SG can decide which deputy is to review each case that falls into this category, the SG or the attorney general can issue guidelines on the meaning of the provision and the standard to be applied in deciding to take an appeal, but, once a deputy a deputy makes a decision, let's say it's a decision not to appeal, nobody, not the attorney general or the President himself, can countermand that. Would that be constitutional?

That's a fairly straightforward line. Yours is a bit more amorphous. I think it's what the Chief was getting to. But I think that what I want to understand is, what is your final test being judged against? Is it I mean, I thought I heard a little bit of the of it when you said the director is setting the policies and procedures. He is he or she is the person who controls the outcome in the sense of setting what the policies and procedures are. Am I right that that's your baseline?

2059,19-1434,Elena_Kagan_,761.34,785.705," Mr. Stewart, you put a lot of weight on the ability of the director to be part of a board that rehears a decision. I I had thought that there was a a usual mechanism for rehearing a decision that didn't you know, that there's a sort of permanent rehearing board, which the director does not pick the other two members of.

2060,19-1434,Elena_Kagan_,848.37,861.9," Right. I think I was talking about that, that that presumptive panel with those particular three members. I mean, the director doesn't merely have full authority over the other two, doesn't does he? He doesn't the other two might disagree with him.

Last term, the Court, in Seila Law, said that executive officials must always remain subject to the ongoing supervision and control of the elected President. Through the President's oversight, the chain of dependence is preserved so that low the lowest officers, the middle grade, and the highest all depend, as they ought, on the President and the President on the community. I I'm struggling to understand how that interpretation of our Constitution squares with your argument that not even the President of the United States, either himself or through his subordinates, can reverse a decision of APJs. Where where is the chain of dependence?

2062,19-1434,Neil_Gorsuch_,974.55,989.34," Again, that's removal, and my question was focused on supervision. If the President disagrees with the decision or one of his designees down the chain of dependence disagrees with the decision, there's no remedy that that the President has, correct?

I'm not sure this wolf comes as a wolf, Mr. Stewart, but I still think it may be a wolf, as Justice Scalia famously said, and he said, in those cases, it can be discerned by careful and perceptive analysis. So here's why here here's the sources of my concern on that front. First, this structure is a real break from tradition, which we've said in cases like Free Enterprise Fund and many others, perhaps the most telling indication of a constitutional problem is the departure the lack of historical precedent. The lack of agency review of the ALJ decision by someone who's appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate is absent here and is ordinarily present and historically has been present. And then, second, the lack of accountability, as the Chief Justice said and Justice Gorsuch was just saying, these are multimillion, sometimes billion-dollar decisions being made not by someone who's accountable in the usual way that the Appointments Clause demands. And the director, on rehearing, does not have the unilateral power to reverse. So, you know, if Congress is going to do that, they can eliminate agency review and prevent removal at will, then it's easy to make these AL APJs presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed. They haven't done that. Where where in that analysis have things has that analysis gone wrong?

On page 38 of your brief, you talk about the strength of the removal power, and you say that because there's an efficiency-of- service standard applicable here and because the director can promulgate regulations, the violation of which might be cause for firing, that those are ways in which the director can exercise some back-end control of the APJs with whom he's not happy with their performance. But isn't it the case, you know, as Arthrex points out, that APJs get the protection of the MSPB, which means that, at the end of the day, the director is actually not the official in the Executive Branch that has the last word on the continuation in service?
",-0.38517487049102783
2065,19-1434,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1325.91,1338.105," I mean, is that sufficient control? The director is unhappy with some of the decisions on review and rehearing, and so he says, okay, well, from now on, you can still do adjudicative adjudicatory work, but it's going to be, you know, this kind instead?

2066,19-1434,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1469.795,1534.1," Mr. Perry, if you won one of these adjudications, you know, in a case involving a billion dollars, which you can have, as Justice Kavanaugh pointed out, you know, you're going to call your client and say, we won the adjudication, and they're going to celebrate. And the next day, you're going to have to call him and say, ah, the director has granted rehearing, he's appointed himself and two others just that think the same way he does to the panel, he's issued new guidance saying in a so-called hypothetical case that looks like ours it should come out the other way, and and the APJ who decided your case is sent to Siberia. You would say that that's not good news, and I it would make something of a charade out of the adjudication. Yet you're relying on all those powers to say that everything is is all right. I mean, it it it really doesn't sound like any kind of adjudication that we would accept, you know, in a system characterized by due process.

2069,19-1434,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,1757.84,1854.405," Mr. Perry, your brief has a very interesting metaphor. You say that the test here is a Goldilocks test, is it is it too hot? So and you also in your brief tick off all the ways in which there is control over over these APJs. So I I'm going to go through these, go through your list and eliminate them one by one, and you tell me the when to stop, when we get to the point where we've crossed the line and there's no longer sufficient control. All right. So let's say that the director does not control whether to institute IPRs in the first place. He does not control how many and which APJs sit on which panels. He does not provide exemplary applications of patent law to fact patterns that are binding on APJs. He does not control whether a panel's decision will be precedential. He does not direct whether a panel's decision will be reheard by controlling whether a Precedential Opinion Panel on which he sits votes to rehear a case. He does not control how many and which APJs rehear a case. He does not decide whether to dismiss an entire APR proceeding rather than allow a panel's decision to become final.

2074,19-1434,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2236.2,2335.985," Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Perry. You mentioned that the other side's argument rests on a single line from Edmond. That, of course, is the critical line from Edmond about the administrative judge context. Just to pick up on Justice Gorsuch, this does seem, and I think you acknowledged, a a significant departure from general historical practice since the APA, which is a yellow flag, if not a red flag. And then your test to try to deal with that seems to resurrect Morrison v. Olson's test. I thought we'd gotten away from that in in Edmond. Justice Alito's questions pointed that out. And what I'm worried about this is the wolf. What I'm worried about is this gives a model for Congress to eliminate agency review of ALJ decisions and kind of fragment and take away from agency control going forward, because this however this came about, to Justice Kagan's question, this would be a model going forward, and that would allow Congress to give extraordinary power to inferior officers, which is not how our government is ordinarily structured. And then, to Justice Sotomayor's question, it seems like ALJs, there's two there's two fixes. You can go with the executive model of ALJs, which is the traditional have ALJs and have agency review or removability, it's usually agency review, not removability with ALJs; or you can make the APJs principal officers with presidential appointment and Senate advice and consent if you want a more judicial model. But, here, the this hybrid gives enormous power to inferior officers, and it's really just out of the norm. Your response?

So I want you to assume for the purposes of my question that you lose on the Appointments Clause issue, and I want to ask you about remedy. So, you know, the federal well, think about one unusual thing about the remedy here is that it's not one specific provision in this statutory scheme that's being challenged as unconstitutional. It's the way that they work together. You know, so we could, if we decided that it was unconstitutional, perhaps make all of the APJs subject to say they're principal officers, and so they have to be subject to presidential appointment, senatorial confirmation. We could say, listen, we're going to strike the provision in the statute that says only the PTAB may grant rehearings so that the director has that authority. We could make them maybe at-will employees, so they're removable at the discretion of the director without having to go through the full process that we discussed before. That's a lot of discretion to give us in trying to shape a remedial a remedy here. Why should we even assert the authority to do that, to sever?

They're adjudicators, they're coming up with particular factual determinations, and you don't want the politically accountable people to have the authority to overturn those in in situations where billions of dollars are at stake, but, at the same time, in terms of basic patent rules and approaches and guidance, you do want them to have that responsibility. Why why isn't that a fair balance?
",0.6650680899620056
2077,19-1434,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2818.9,2840.455," Well, not any of your actual decisions, but can certainly take actions that would redirect any mistakes that the director sees in how a particular case was handled for the implementation of patent policy according to the President's directives, the President's responsibilities.
",-0.3557601571083069
2078,19-1434,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2891.385,2918.69," What about the argument that, as a matter of practicality, which is something that the government has to take into account, what you're supposing is is really quite impractical? Hundreds and hundreds of administrative hearing examiners, as at least they used to be called, making these sorts of decisions, the notion of meaningful review of each one seems to me to be fanciful.
",0.7215644717216492
2079,19-1434,Clarence_Thomas_,3120.92,3154.345," Well, let me ask you one more question then. The assuming that Congress addresses the problem by providing the director with discretion, could the director then delegate that authority to the APJs and the various structures within the organization to basically the way it exists now by statute, but the the director accomplishes that by delegation? Would that be okay?
",-1.3265397548675537
2080,19-1434,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3206.42,3255.64," But following up on what Justice Thomas says, I mean, I don't why is this an unusual matter of delegation? I mean, after all, the government is filled with all kinds of different people. Doctors in practice may have final authority to decide at the Veterans Administration whether you're on your right day for an appointment. Sergeants will decide what hill to take in the Army. Inspectors general may decide who is a whistleblower and have absolutely unreviewable authority to send something over to Congress to say what that whistleblower said. There are many shapes and sizes. And some and Congress I mean, you're saying Congress can't restrict their authority at all, no matter what the shape and what the size? Or can they do it --

2081,19-1434,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3321.63,3386.86999995," now we've got we're finding out what you're looking for, the other side is saying this: Given the complexity of the federal government, of course, there are going to be vast numbers of different cases, so we have three basic things to look at: What's the position in respect to the President of the individual? What's the nature of that job? And what is the nature of the delegation of non-reviewable authority? I mean, even magistrates and lower court judges decide things without review, such as a denial of summary judgment. What's the nature of the authority delegated, what's the nature of the job, what's the distance from the President, and it all comes under the rubric policy. Is it taking too many policy matters away from the President? So an adjudicator will have more authority, possible. And so will a whistleblower, inspector general. And maybe somebody else won't. Maybe somebody in the Nuclear do you see do you see what they're driving at? So what's your response to that?

2082,19-1434,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3452.78,3497.485," Mr. Lamken, let's assume that we agree with you that this current scheme violates the Appointments Clause. You say in your brief we shouldn't go any further; we should leave it to Congress to decide what to do to fix the problem. But that really doesn't answer the question of what relief you should get in this case. I I assume you would not be satisfied if, at the end of this case, the only thing that you obtain is a declaration that the current scheme is unconstitutional, but nothing is done to disturb the decision of the board, right? You wouldn't be satisfied with that?
",0.8783143162727356
2083,19-1434,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3513.055,3554.385," Well, you you want us to go beyond simply saying that there was a violation and, Congress, you fix it as you see fit. You want us to grant you want the judiciary to grant you a form of relief, namely, a decision vacating the decision of the board. That is a form of relief. Why is that a more modest form of relief a more modest form of relief than some of the alternatives, such as saying that you are entitled to have the director review the decision of the board?

2084,19-1434,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3561.56,3598.57999995," We wouldn't we wouldn't rewrite the statute. What the Court would say is this is what the Constitution requires. The law is I mean, Professor Harrison makes this point repeatedly, and it seems like a convincing point. The law is a combination of what the Constitution requires and any statutory additions to what the Constitution requires. So, if the Constitution requires some alteration of the current statutory scheme, so be it. And that is an alteration that would possibly bring this into compliance with the Constitution.

And I I I don't think you can I don't think it's an answer to say don't make any choice at all, just say that we win. That is a choice. That is a form of relief, is it not?

2086,19-1434,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3706.11,3877.47," Counsel, I find it odd not odd to protect Congress's prerogative, but it's nothing that we do will tie Congress's hand. And one thing we do know is that they can change anything we do as a temporary remedy, assuming we were to rule in your favor. But I I have a problem with our jurisprudence as as it's developed in this hand in in these cases. And the founding generation conceived of principal officers as synonymous with heads of departments. In early debates and enactments that structured executive department, heads of the department were were referred to as principal officers and other members as inferior officers. There's a whole history that many of those inferior officers took final decisions in a wide variety of areas. Yet that's the way we proceeded. The history also shows that early statutes gave non-principal officers the power to make final adjudicatory decisions on behalf of the executive. Your opposing counsel pointed out that as early as 1793, non-principal officers were given the power to adjudicate patent disputes, and in 1803, land commissioners were given the power to make final determinations as to a claimant's right to a tract of land. I personally read this history as suggesting that principal officers were intended to be policymakers, and individuals who merely adjudicated claims based on said policies were not principal officers. So, for me, the person that has to be held responsible is not the individual ILJ or ALJ who is making a decision. It's the person who creates the policy. And for me, it's clear that APJs are not policymakers. All of the policies are vested in the director. Precedential power is put in the director. The ALJs cannot influence the course of the law. That's only the director. So please tell me why the individual decision based on a quasi-law precedent and policy set by the director is a final decision that that director won't be held responsible for.
",0.7765048146247864
2087,19-1434,Elena_Kagan_,4044.9,4107.39," let's think about what you just said in reference to Edmond. In Edmond, as you said and this is why you said a clear error standard would have to suffice the standard was is there competent evidence in the record. Now, if I think about that standard, I mean, when is there not competent evidence in the record? So I guess I'm wondering how Edmond is at all consistent with some of the statements that you've been making this this morning? You said that, you know, it's it's if if the head of the agency can say he had no authority, the head of if the head of the agency can say it's not his fault, then that is then that dooms the system. But the CAAF could have said all those things: we have no authority, it's not our fault, there was competent evidence in in in the record. I mean, it wasn't very good evidence and the evidence in our view was outweighed by much better evidence, but it was competent, so it's not our fault.
",0.7382372617721558
2088,19-1434,Elena_Kagan_,4115.61,4147.475," respect to many decisions, the the the critical question is what the evidence says, and, you know, putting aside whether there's there's de novo legal authority, you know, many decisions the CAAF would be able to say, you know, this was in the end a decision about the evidence, and we basically have no authority with respect to judgments about how good the evidence is. As long as there's, like, something there, we have to go along, it's not our fault.
",0.6404168605804443
2089,19-1434,Elena_Kagan_,4168.135,4207.27499995," I mean, I I guess what I'm just wondering is whether this doesn't suggest that this question of review is something that's not an on/off switch as to this single issue but something that needs to be put into the mix and needs to be considered along with all the other evidence of of of control that the agency head has. The reason why this competent evidence standard was okay in Edmond was not that, you know, it itself was there because, you know, competent evidence standard doesn't give you much. It was because it was combined with a raft of other things.

2090,19-1434,Neil_Gorsuch_,4316.66,4355.52," So, Mr. Lamken, in our last couple of cases, Seila Law and Free Enterprise, we were able to get in and get out rather cleanly, severing only the removal provisions, and, of course, that took care of the the constitutional problem there. Here, you you indicate that supervision is a real problem and more machinations are required. But the SG offers us a a what it thinks is a clean answer on I think it's about page 40 of its brief that we we just sever the provision in Section 6(c) that says only the PTAB may grant rehearing. Why why isn't that sufficient?
",0.0060671973042190075
2091,19-1434,Neil_Gorsuch_,4388.7,4402.79," we'd have to we'd have to blue-line not only that language in 6(c) that says only the PTAB, but you're also pointing out that first part of Section 6(c) that says shall be heard by three members, fine. Is is that would would would that do it?
",-1.0754560232162476
2092,19-1434,Neil_Gorsuch_,4485.92,4500.765," one option you've given one option you've given us is to simply set aside the IPR determination, remand the case to the agency, and then wait for Congress to fix the problem. I'm sure some would argue that, well, that could take a long time. What what's your response to that?

2093,19-1434,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4562.065,4605.575," Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Lamken. I want to follow up on some other of my colleagues' questions and then turn to severability. First, following up on the Chief's questions, my understanding of your position is that you take the position that ALJs within the Executive Branch may be somewhat of an uneasy constitutional solution, but it's historically settled, we have tenure protection, plus agency review, and that gives due process but also gives ultimate agency control of policy. That's kind of the historically settled solution. You want to preserve that, correct?
",-0.23066136240959167
2094,19-1434,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4618.49,4642.52," here, the problem is Congress departed from that tradition by keeping the due process part without the agency review part, and you can either keep the review if you want to keep them as inferior officers, or if you want to avoid agency any agency review, Congress can do that too, but that, they'd have to do presidential appointment and Senate confirmation of the APJs, correct?
",-0.31939318776130676
2095,19-1434,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4648.895,4663.31," Okay. And then Justice Thomas asked about how it would be different if delegated, in other words, if the power of review were granted to the director and then it's delegated. Your answer to that, I think, was accountability, is that correct?
",-1.0046290159225464
2096,19-1434,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4683.87,4702.945," And then Justice Breyer asked about inspector generals. He asked about other officers too, but, on inspector generals, my understanding is those are presidential-appointed and Senate-confirmed, and there actually would be a pretty big problem if they were not at least if they had tenure protection and were not presidential-appointed and Senate-confirmed. Do you have any different understanding of that?
",-0.6655184626579285
2097,19-1434,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4746.16,4758.375," just in Edmond just to clarify one thing, I think this comes from Justice Kagan's questions in Edmond, there was both review of some sort she asked you to pinpoint that but review of some sort but also removability at will, correct?
",-1.2561851739883423
2098,19-1434,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4768.08,4806.37," let me turn because I I've got to turn quickly to severability. So, if we agree with you on the merits, you want to then take down the whole system, and we've frowned upon that repeatedly. And severability, I mean, maybe something of a misnomer in some respects, really follows from the nature of the constitutional problem. We declare what the nature of the constitutional problem is. We say then we enter judgment, and then stare decisis means that that constitutional problem exists for all cases. Isn't the nature of the constitutional problem here the lack of director review, which would mean us saying 6(c) is the constitutional problem?

2099,19-1434,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4833.41,4877.95999995," Mr. Lamken, I want to pick up where Justice Kavanaugh left off on the remedy here and severability. So, on pages 56 and 57 of your brief, you cite Sorrell and Bowsher and Free Enterprise, and you cite them all for the the proposition that if there are multiple ways to cure a constitutional problem in a statutory scheme, then the judiciary ought not be blue-penciling it. Can you think of any situation in which we have said, okay, well, there are multiple flaws in this scheme, but, you know, as Justice Kavanaugh was just saying, 6(b) seems to be the big problem, so we're going to think it's the cleanest to go that route? Are are you can you tell me the negative, that we've never done it?
",0.23251575231552124
2100,19-1434,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4905.65,4926.795," to make one that makes sense. I mean, let's say that Justice Kavanaugh is right and that it seems very sensible and makes a lot of sense to solve this problem, assuming that we say there is one, by saying 6(b) is the problem, so that's that's the locus of the constitutional problem here, and we're going to say that that's what we're holding unconstitutional so that going forward, it's just that the PTAB can't have the final word.
",0.9139929413795471
2101,19-1434,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4934.44,4960.26," Mr. Lamken, but what I'm asking is, can you cite a case or are you telling me that there is none? Can you cite a case for the proposition where we have done just that? Understanding that that runs against what you want us to do here, I'm just asking, is there a negative? Is it the case that we've always had the position that we had in Sorrell and we've never said that when there might be multiple provisions working together that create a problem or multiple ways of solving it, that we haven't just chosen one that makes sense?
",0.03953985869884491
2102,19-1434,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4998.65,5042.875," let me let me pivot to the Appointments Clause issue. So Justice Kagan was pointing out there are many way in which we would say that APJs are subordinate to the director, and it seems to me that one way to look at this case is to say that at a 10,000-foot level, if you look at front-end controls, you know, if you look at hiring and and firing and the ability of the director to set policy that the APJs must follow, in many respects, they're inferior officers, and we might say that Congress has given them this one authority, this case-specific review authority, that is one that is inconsistent with the inferior officer role. But it does it does seem odd, doesn't it, to say that they are principal officers because they exercise this one piece of authority that seems to go beyond what an inferior officer can do?

2103,19-1039,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,132.94,153.775," Mr. Clement, do you have any other examples outside the area of eminent domain where the federal government can delegate its powers to a private party and then the private party can exercise those those powers in a way that's inconsistent with state rights?
",-1.1097882986068726
2104,19-1039,Clarence_Thomas_,425.305,448.595," You know, I think you might have a better argument, in rem argument if possession of the land or the rem was in the custody of the courts, but this is the interest we're talking about is in New Jersey and it's under either possessory or control of New Jersey.

2105,19-1039,Stephen_G_Breyer_,486.9,514.385," There are a number of cases where this Court has said if you're going to interfere with the sovereign immunity rights of the state, Congress has to do so clearly. You've read them. What are the ones take the ones, whatever three or two or three you think are the strongest against you, and then explain to me how you distinguish them. I'd appreciate that.

2106,19-1039,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,583.59,623.51999995," Mr. Clement, let's start with the reason why a state may be sued by the United States. Is this a correct understanding of the reason for that rule? When New Jersey and other states entered the union and they read the Constitution, they saw the federal structure that was set up, and they read the the scope of federal power federal judicial power under Article III, they had to realize that this meant that they were surrendering that portion of their sovereign immunity.
",-0.8647863864898682
2107,19-1039,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,636.535,715.875," Okay. The Supremacy Clause and Article III. But this was something that this Court thought they must have realized when they entered the union. This was part of the bargain. Now I understand your argument that they must also have realized that a sovereign can deputize a private party to exercise a condemnation power, and, therefore, because they were surrendering their immunity from a condemnation suit by the United States, they necessarily were also surrendering their immunity with respect to a private party that might be deputized to exercise that power. But is that a fair inference? Is it a is it a sufficient inference? Would it not have been entirely reasonable for a state to think, look, okay, we understand we're giving up our sovereign immunity against a condemnation suit by the United States, but we don't think that we necessarily are giving up our sovereign immunity with respect to a condemnation suit by a delegee, even though this is a rule that applies in other contexts?
",0.22860722243785858
2108,19-1039,Sonia_Sotomayor_,797.295,829.24," Mr. Clement, perhaps I don't understand these features, and and delegation is troublesome for me. And this doesn't apply to FERC, but can a can if if we didn't have FERC, could the government have delegated in your use of the term to a private entity the decision as to what route was necessary and to then condemn those portions of the route that it thought necessary?
",-0.2686462104320526
2109,19-1039,Sonia_Sotomayor_,912.345,962.92," Counsel, your adversaries point to certain aspects of a condemnation proceeding that seem to lend themselves to sovereign-to-sovereign decisionmaking. I do agree with you that just the simple appraisal is different, how much is this land worth, and you could you hire a lawyer and the lawyer helps you with that. You can hire a party that does the same thing. That's basically your argument. But how about the negotiation aspects? The state argues that there is a sovereign-to-sovereign part of this process, which is you're not supposed to start condemnation until you had negotiation, and why should I be forced as a sovereign to negotiate with a nonsovereign?
",0.13131755590438843
2110,19-1039,Elena_Kagan_,1012.2,1053.475," Mr. Clement, you told the Chief Justice that we shouldn't think of this as a case about a private party condemning land, that we should think that that PennEast essentially steps into the shoes of the government. And that raises questions in my mind as to what the government involvement in this case was. In other words, was there any supervision by the government? Was there any participation by the government? Did any lawyers for the United States approve the timing of the condemnation action? Did any lawyers for the United States approve the parcels to be condemned? Is there anything that the that the U.S. itself was involved in in this case?
",-0.39961621165275574
2111,19-1039,Elena_Kagan_,1128.075,1165.59," So New Jersey says that there were a whole range of things that PennEast did that the U.S. Government would not have done. You know, New Jersey says the U.S. has an obligation to negotiate in good faith, while New while you refused to negotiate, that that you rushed to condemn the land before the route was finalized in a way that the U.S. Government would have wouldn't have, that your interest in land valuation is different, in other words, that there were a whole set of litigation tactics or moves that a private party would have been would have perfectly legitimately made that the U.S. Government would not have.

2112,19-1039,Neil_Gorsuch_,1228.455,1269.505," We focused a lot on what what I call structural immunity under the Constitution and maybe a little less on the Eleventh Amendment. I I'd just like to ask a question about that. I I understand the argument that PennEast steps into the shoes of the federal government in many senses, but and I understand that PennEast is a citizen of Delaware. That's what the lower court said. We have before us a suit in law or equity. Kohl says that. So why doesn't this case fall within the plain text of the Eleventh Amendment itself, which limits the judicial power of the United States in cases by a citizen of one state against another state?

At least as I read the briefs, I don't see any historical support for the proposition that a state could be sued by a private party, you know, standing in the stead the private party standing in the stead of the federal government's eminent-domain power. The cases that you cite, like immovable property cases, like Georgia versus Chattanooga, all kind of rely on inference. And, I mean, so far as I can tell too, it wasn't until 1876 in Kohl that the federal government even instituted a condemnation action against a state. So is your Plan of the Convention argument not really your strongest one, and is your in rem and Hood argument better?

2116,19-1039,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2319.94,2346.355," I'd like to address your jurisdictional argument. It does seem strange to require a state to initiate litigation in one court of appeals, in D.C., in order to invoke sovereign immunity in another when it hasn't been sued yet, so there's no existing claim against it that it could raise a defense in. How does that make sense?
",-0.07197800278663635
2117,19-1039,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2383.22,2412.395," So isn't this I mean, instead of requiring a suit in in the D.C. Circuit to decide this issue, why couldn't you just why couldn't PennEast have just raised this as, I guess, collateral estoppel? Because that's really its argument, isn't it? That the delegation to PennEast could have and wasn't wasn't challenged in the D.C. Circuit, so it's collateral estoppel?

2118,19-1039,Elena_Kagan_,2461.385,2481.355," Mr. Kneedler, suppose the federal government didn't like something about the way PennEast was conducting this litigation, whether it had to do with negotiating with New Jersey or with valuation decisions or anything else. If the U.S. didn't approve of something, could it do anything and, if so, what?
",-0.7951032519340515
2119,19-1039,Elena_Kagan_,2527.4,2550.98," I guess, Mr. Kneedler, my concern here is that, I mean, in several cases, we've talked about the need for a suit against states to be conducted by politically responsible actors, federal lawyers, and and whether there's not something that's really lost by giving this over to private parties, who have their own interests separate and apart from what the government's might be.
",0.2353450506925583
2120,19-1039,Neil_Gorsuch_,2591.11,2637.28," So, Mr. Kneedler, I'd just like to return to the Eleventh Amendment itself, putting aside larger questions of structural or sovereign immunity. And we I discussed with Mr. Clement, you know, whether PennEast is a citizen of Delaware. That's one issue. And then the other is whether we have a suit in law and equity, and the in rem was was proffered as a way to get around that. But I'm not sure how that happens when this Court has said repeatedly, as far back as 1875 in Kohl versus United States, that a proceeding to take land and determine compensation is a proceeding in at common law, would seem to be a suit in law and equity, whatever else it is. So what what what's wrong with that? Why why why doesn't this fall within the plain text of the Eleventh Amendment itself?

2121,19-1039,Neil_Gorsuch_,2680.37,2691.41," Well, just but, I mean, help me with that, because a suit against the state at at law or in equity, and this Court has said a taking a proceeding to take land and determine compensation is just such a thing.
",-0.17825832962989807
2122,19-1039,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2760.91,2802.52," Mr. Kneedler, I have a question just to follow up on one that Justice Gorsuch asked you. You said that you thought, when he was asking you about the Eleventh Amendment, that maybe the better way to think of this was that it was a suit against the state. And I've been trying to get my mind around what role this in rem issue plays in all this and particularly because Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 71.1 required the state to be joined as a as a party, as the property owner. So, if you say the better way to think of it is really as a suit against the state, you said you've accepted PennEast's argument about the in rem nature of the proceeding, how does 71.1 and the in rem nature of the proceeding and your concession to Justice Gorsuch bear on that?
",-0.707732081413269
2123,19-1039,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2828.93,2849.275," Well, no, no, no, I understand that, but I'm asking specifically, you said to Justice Gorsuch that the better way to think of this is that it's a party against the state. So I was asking how that bears on how we should think about this specifically as an in rem proceeding, because that's one of PennEast's arguments, of course, that that sovereign immunity doesn't apply here. So is it in rem or is it more in personam?
",0.23512724041938782
2124,19-1039,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,3233.905,3274.525," No, no, I I'm not suggesting that it's enough to eliminate the immunity, but it does strike me as the concern why supporting Mr. Clement and Mr. Kneedler's argument that you're dealing here with a federal delegee. And what the State is doing is in other words, the the federal government in this scenario does become a junior varsity sovereign. The state is blocking the NGA certificate issued by the by the federal sovereign. Do you have a response to that?
",0.1034511998295784
2125,19-1039,Clarence_Thomas_,3440.72,3461.195," So the let me ask you, just an opportunity, I'd like you to to respond to the Petitioner and to some extent the U.S.'s argument that because this is an in rem action it doesn't implicate sovereign immunity at all.
",-0.3975154757499695
2126,19-1039,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3622.685,3782.9," Yeah. Thank you. Go back for a minute to the late 1940s, early 1950s. Most of the natural gas was in the Permian Basin in Oklahoma and in Texas, and they were on the verge of or had built pipelines to carry that natural gas to California, San Diego, El Paso Natural Gas, or up to Pennsylvania, over to Illinois, up to Massachusetts. A lot of the states not a lot, but some were objecting in a whole variety of complex ways. And so Congress passed the Natural Gas Act. Now they couldn't have built the pipelines unless they had this power, I think, I'm not certain of that, but I don't see how they could have because they need go look at the map on the the map of waterways in which Pennsylvania claims an interest in the Marcellus Shale Coalition. They zone water beds. They own all kinds of obstacles. But this was passed to build a pipeline. How could they have done it? I don't see it. And having known a little bit about that, since you need the federal power or a government power to for a private person to use eminent domain for anything against a private land or by a state, I don't understand how they would have how any reasonable person would have delegated any eminent-domain power to the Natural Gas Act, which was for interstate pipelines, without including the power to proceed against the state. Am I right about that? And, if I am right and, therefore, it is clearly in this statute, why in heaven's name can't the Federal Power Commission then, or FERC now, have done the same thing? And if they could have done the same thing under law of Congress, why can't they hire somebody, just as Mississippi hires private prosecutors sometimes in criminal cases? Or there are dozens of examples where private persons are delegated under supervision, and, here, the supervision is close, to go and do something that the public can do by bringing a criminal case, et cetera, et cetera. Do you see the thrust of my argument? Very historical. But that's been the understanding for the last 80 years.
",0.596527636051178
2127,19-1039,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3802.96,3831.89," No, sorry. My the thrust of my question, why I kept saying historical, is I do know how states behaved in the late '40s and early '50s. And from reading the newspapers, I know that natural gas is a subject of a big argument politically in a lot of states, some thinking it's great for the environment and others think others thinking it doesn't go far enough, it has risks. Those are the two things I know. Not speculation.

2128,19-1039,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3907.785,3953.585," Counsel, sometimes form is dispositive and you may in the end have a winning formal argument, but what I want to look into is whether you have anything more than a purely formal argument. Now you argue that things might have worked out better for you if FERC as opposed to PennEast were conducting the proceeding because the federal government is obligated to negotiate in bad faith and there's the issue of timing. But I take it your constitutional argument would be in the end exactly the same if none of those features appeared in the statute that's involved here, would it not?
",-0.15850278735160828
2129,19-1039,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3982.45,4014.695," Yeah. No, I I understand that, but if PennEast were require required to negotiate in good faith, if all of this was the timing was they couldn't bring a condemnation action until the route had been finalized so that FERC had approved the very route in question and knew that it was going over state land and wanted the presumably wanted the land condemned, and all that was left to be done was to file a condemnation action, ascertain the value of the property, you would have exactly the same constitutional objection?
",-0.08124630898237228
2130,19-1039,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4075.325,4104.78," Counsel, just to be clear, other than your argument that PennEast didn't negotiate in good faith, contrary to the finding of the court below, all of the other arguments you mentioned throughout your presentation to Justice Alito and others are about issues that you litigated in the D.C. courts, didn't you --
",-0.658109188079834
2131,19-1039,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4105.47,4124.4," about well, you litigated about whether they should wait, and and the government responded, not in the way you liked, but it did. What else what else did you not have an opportunity to or didn't litigate in that case?
",-0.8166422843933105
2132,19-1039,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4196.97,4285.32000005," Well, but you could have appealed that. Going to Justice Alito's question about formalistic, it seems to me that history is very important to me, and I think that was the point of Justice Breyer's position, which is that for at least 150 years, states, some states, not all, have been delegating to private parties their power their the power of eminent domain, and the federal government and other agencies have done it, and no one has raised this argument because, if one accepts Mr. Clement's argument, there was no sense that there was a sovereign immunity to eminent domain, the exercise of eminent domain by the federal government or by a state against its own citizens, and, hence, who they delegate that power to, unlike the other cases that we've addressed this issue or this issue has been around that only the state can do, and at least in this narrow field, the in rem nature of this proceeding has gone differently in history than in the normal cases.
",0.3588145673274994
2133,19-1039,Elena_Kagan_,4430.11,4466.35," You spoke to Justice Alito about the state's dignitary interest and said that this has been a consistent through line in our sovereign immunity cases. Most of those cases in the modern era have had powerful dissents attached to them, and those dissents have have have basically said, what are you talking about, about this dignitary interest? What dignitary interest does a state have in in being why is it why is it any less or greater if a private party or the United States is involved? So can you explain that to me? Like, what is the supposed dignitary interest?
",-0.5258468389511108
2134,19-1039,Elena_Kagan_,4521.405,4546.96499995," If you go back to this question of whether there was founding-era consent, I think what PennEast would say is that you knew you were consenting to suits against the federal government and you knew that governments routinely use delegations to to effectuate eminent-domain suits. So you put those two things together, why didn't you consent to suits of exactly this kind?
",-0.19936317205429077
2135,19-1039,Neil_Gorsuch_,4596.335,4642.31," I'd like to return to the question of whether this is a suit against the state. In some respects, it seems pretty hard to dispute that the state is named as a party, and under Rule 71.1, the complaint had to file suit against both property and at least one of the property owners. And, of course, there's going to be compensation due to the state. That would seem to be more in personam than than in rem. But there's also long strand of thinking about condemnation proceedings as in rem, as the notes to the rule make clear. And, of course, we've heard some argument today that this that's the better way to conceive of these kinds of suits. Can you speak to that a little further?
",-0.18201573193073273
2136,19-1039,Neil_Gorsuch_,4682.49,4700.11," No, I I I'm sorry to cut you off there, but I I understand that. I remember Upper Skagit. I may be the only person who does, but I do having gotten saddled with that one, but it was a delightful assignment. But that that has to do with property outside the state. What about inside the state?
",0.5278909206390381
2137,19-1039,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4776.03,4823.99," Thank you. And welcome, General. I just want to ask one question. In your brief, you respond to PennEast's arguments about what will happen if you were to prevail in this case, and you respond by saying, well, of course, Congress could take action. And then you say this is page 45 but even absent congressional action, PennEast is hardly without options. And then I want to focus on your first one there. First, while the United States disclaims authority under the NGA to condemn property, the lower courts have had no occasion to consider this question, and this issue deserves greater exploration. So is that a real thing or or or not, what you're offering there?
",0.10548662394285202
2138,19-1039,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4904.895,4918.825," Let me ask you about the Fifth Amendment and how it might relate to the immovable property doctrine. Do you agree that all of your land or your property is private property for Fifth Amendment purposes, which is what permits you to have a takings claim in the first place?
",-1.552205204963684
2139,19-1039,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4960.46,4989.525," Well, doesn't it bear on the immovable property argument that PennEast is making that, you know, if a state has property, if Georgia has property within the borders of Tennessee, you know, the immovable property, Georgia can be sued because it's treated basically as the equivalent of a private landowner because it's not land within its sovereign territory, but if the Fifth Amendment treats this as private property for those purposes, doesn't that strengthen PennEast's argument about the immovable property doctrine?
",-0.11412250250577927
2140,19-1039,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5023.29,5034.775," I want to go back to something you said to Justice Thomas about possessory and or the kinds of property interests at stake. You told Justice Thomas that the state had nine possessory property interests. If that's right is that right?
",-0.5683289170265198
2141,19-1039,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5076.675,5093.28," Okay. Last question. In your view, would there be anything to stop you or any other state from waiting until FERC approved the pipeline's route and then purchasing a property interest in land within the pipeline's path and then asserting state sovereign immunity?
",-1.1031899452209473
2142,19-1414,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,131.555,178.925," Mr. Feigin, you you got my attention when you said began by saying every single source says that tribes have this inherent authority. I would have thought Montana said the exact opposite. You know, you do argue at the outset there's this inherent authority and nothing took it away. But, as we said in South Dakota versus Bourland, describing it, Montana, and this is a quote, it said, ""After Montana, tribal sovereignty over non-members cannot survive without express congressional delegation and is, therefore, not inherent."" So I would have described that as at least one source that says the opposite of what you said.
",0.3770609498023987
2143,19-1414,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,250.1,273.42," I understand that as an alternative theory, and and, you know, we can we can talk about that. But you you say Montana applies to legislative and civil and regulatory. On what basis would you suggest that executive power, such as is being exercised here, is subject to a different rule than legislative and judicial power?
",-0.9410025477409363
2144,19-1414,Clarence_Thomas_,302.165,331.52," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Feigin, the the Ninth Circuit analogized the police officer here to a private citizen. And if we accept that, that the police officer is actually a private citizen here, then why does the statute, the Indian Civil Rights Act, even apply?
",-0.659692108631134
2145,19-1414,Clarence_Thomas_,406.615,429.34000005," So, if we if if we find that that the officer here was within his jurisdiction to engage in this stop, do we have to should we ultimately reverse here, or should we send it back to have it analyzed to determine whether or not Terry is satisfied?
",-1.4398926496505737
2146,19-1414,Stephen_G_Breyer_,536.62,560.67," Do you would you like to and could you help explain to me an ordinary state policeman has certain authority to make arrests or to investigate situations on an interstate highway. How how in your view does the tribal policeman have the same or a lesser authority and why?
",-1.7301305532455444
2147,19-1414,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,755.235,783.55," Mr. Feigin, do you think you could offer us a general test for distinguishing between those aspects of sovereignty that tribes retained and those that they did not? So, if you if I gave you this partial sentence, I wonder if you could complete it: Tribes retain those aspects of sovereignty that fill in the rest.
",-1.6972464323043823
2148,19-1414,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,843.91,887.925," Does the authority you claim the tribes retain go further than simply detaining a non-Indian on reasonable suspicion? I think you you just said in answer to Justice Breyer that a tribal officer could not actually make an arrest. Could the could the officer make a the kind of search incident to arrest that would otherwise be possible? For example, if a non-Indian was in the car in a car, could the officer search areas of the car that the person could grab and might have where there might be a weapon hidden?
",-0.6247289776802063
2149,19-1414,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,908.235,934.795," Well, suppose a suppose a tribal officer is is is not is not stopping a car on the highway but is driving around the reservation and sees through the window of a house owned by a non-Indian on a parcel of land that this individual owns and see that there is drugs in plain view. Could what can the officer do under those circumstances?
",-1.3606270551681519
2150,19-1414,Sonia_Sotomayor_,968.56,1030.68," Mr. Feigin, basically, in your briefs, you've argued that this Court should look to whether the exercise of tribal sovereignty would be consistent with the overriding interests of the federal government. I'm not quite sure what that has to do with much. Shouldn't we be looking at what rights the Indians, the tribal Indians, have been given? And, here, it seems to me that inherent in a detention-and-hold right is the right to investigation. The Ninth Circuit basically said that they can investigate to find out if someone's an Indian or not. And if they're an Indian, presumably, they would have all the rights of further investigation. But I don't know why the Ninth Circuit's limited view of what the right of detention means should control us.
",0.29726338386535645
2151,19-1414,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1032.97,1059.775," And and and isn't that a simpler argument than all the arguments that about sovereignty that everyone's been having? If it's a contractual right the Indians have been given, there's no constitutional violation in just being held for the police to determine whether or not you're guilty of a crime sufficient to be arrested. Why can't we just go in on that simple basis?
",0.31413158774375916
2152,19-1414,Elena_Kagan_,1173.305,1198.77," Mr. Feigin, if you could continue with this point. I guess what I'd like to know is, if there are these two alternative ways that you could have written your brief, and one is the inherent authority way, which you, in fact, used, and the other is the Montana exception 2 way, what are the different consequences of the Court proceeding along either of these paths? And why did you make the choice that you did?
",-0.9969294667243958
2153,19-1414,Elena_Kagan_,1267.03,1282.88," I guess, Mr. Feigin, I really was just asking about you said we just don't think Montana applies. But, other than sort of analytic purity in your mind, you have no you don't see any real difference between the two approaches?
",0.09150863438844681
2154,19-1414,Elena_Kagan_,1305.86,1320.15," I I guess what I'm really asking is, like, what what are these different implications? I mean, I'm just sort of not understanding why you're pushing down one road rather than the other and and thought I'd just ask you, why are you pushing down one road rather than the other?
",0.2012946903705597
2155,19-1414,Neil_Gorsuch_,1373.55,1444.13," Good morning, counsel. I I I guess I would have approached this thinking that tribal sovereignty remains until and unless Congress has withdrawn it in some fashion and that the relevant question here is, what what does the Major Crimes Act do to Indian sovereignty? And, there, it's clear that Congress has withdrawn jurisdiction to try certain non-native people in certain locations within Indian country. Fine. My question approaching it that way, Mr. Feigin, is, where is the line? The Major Crimes Act clearly precludes states or or tribes from trying certain individuals, non-native persons, for for major crimes in Indian country. But you say it's okay, on the other hand, to for a tribal officer to conduct a Terry stop. There's a long distance between a Terry stop and a trial. Where does where does the Major Crimes Act kick in to reduce tribal sovereignty?
",-0.28178268671035767
2156,19-1414,Neil_Gorsuch_,1547,1566.14," Oh, yeah, but you're saying they they possessed that authority antecedent to any statute. And and and I guess my question, again, is, where does that sovereign authority end that's been preserved? And why would it stop at Terry as opposed to an arrest?
",-0.31280291080474854
2157,19-1414,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1715.955,1741.48," The other side says this is, in effect, a separation of powers case and that Congress has given the executive the authority to enter into cross-deputization and that hasn't been done here and that, instead of the courts jumping in, we should let Congress and the Executive Branch fill any public policy holes that may exist. Your response?
",-0.7345079779624939
2158,19-1414,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1799.385,1848.125," Mr. Feigin, I'd like to go back to your interchange with Justice Gorsuch. You said that the authority the investigative authority doesn't extend past Terry stops into arrests because arrests mark the beginning of the adjudicatory process. We I I didn't quite follow whether you were saying to Justice Gorsuch that the reason why tribes lack authority to arrest is because they are implicitly divested of that authority under the Constitution, so even under the Colville rationale or whether it's the cross-deputization statutes or whether it's our prior cases making clear that tribes lack the authority to finally adjudicate the rights, criminally or civilly, of non-members. So could you just explain to me what it is that takes away that authority, or is it that they never possessed it in the first place?
",0.05177227780222893
2159,19-1414,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1929.335,1968.87," Well, this is my problem, and I'm not suggesting that I think we should say that it stretches that far, but I'm trying to figure out what rationale says that the tribes would retain the authority to do a Terry stop but not to arrest, particularly when you think about the fact that, I mean, one one reason for the practical problems that you identify is that it's difficult for federal or state authorities to police the public rights-of-way that go through reservations. So, if a tribal officer does a Terry stop, I mean, a Terry stop's supposed to be temporary, who knows how long it might take for a state or federal officer to get there. And then, at some point, you know, as you get I don't know, at some point, it seems like that would mature into an arrest.
",0.620076596736908
2160,19-1414,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2193.9,2267.90000005," Counsel, I I think, as Justice Kagan summarized, there's a very important distinction with of broader applicability than this case over how you should look at it. Your friend on the other side says there's inherent authority and it hasn't been the question is whether it's been taken away. He cites Colville. I understand your argument to be that, under Montana and subsequent cases interpreting it, there is no inherent authority. But even under Montana, there are exceptions, exceptions in which we've recognized that there is continuing inherent authority, and I wonder why the second exception doesn't apply here. That exception is when the conduct at issue threatens tribal self-governance, self-rule, which we've talked about in terms of political integrity, economic security, health and welfare. What could threaten that more than the idea that you can't do anything about somebody within the reservation that you have good reason to believe is violating criminal law? It would seem to me that's the prototypical case for the exception.
",0.7289333939552307
2161,19-1414,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2285.165,2313.99," Right. I think that's a fair fair description, but those were, as has been pointed out, regulatory, civil, adjudicatory, and you can certainly argue it makes sense to have a very limited view in in that context. But, when you're talking about on-the-ground criminal activity, I wonder if the exception should not be as narrow as it is in those other contexts?

2162,19-1414,Clarence_Thomas_,2368.605,2427.2," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'd like to continue along that line, counsel. The let's change the the facts in this case just a bit so that rather than the police officer looking and determining that the Respondent was nervous and that he may had bloodshot eyes; rather, he fit the description of a serial killer that the police officer was alerted to, a serial killer who did not commit any of the crimes on the reservation but happened to be exactly where Respondent was. How would you would you make the exact same argument in that case?
",-0.42817753553390503
2163,19-1414,Clarence_Thomas_,2435.41,2463.44," No, I just the only facts I've changed in your case, in this case, is that rather than the Respondent being there with bloodshot eyes and sleepy, et cetera, he fit the description that the police officer heard over his radio of a serial killer, but, other than that, all the facts are the same.

I mean, you know, people look you can't just look at them and see whether whether they're Indians or not or people look different, so I think that would be a tough one to do. But but suppose he turns out doesn't look like a member of the tribe. Then what?

2166,19-1414,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2749,2819.73000005," Counsel, it does seem to me that determining whether a person is an Indian, which can mean a member of any tribe, not just the particular tribe whose land is at issue, may be more difficult than you suggest. But what is the tribal officer supposed to do after determining pretty clearly that a person is not an Indian? So consider the situation where the tribal officer has reasonable suspicion that a driver is driving under the influence and would present a danger if allowed to continue to drive, but the officer is pretty certain this person is not an Indian. Let's say the the person has a a a European Union driver's license and shows plane tickets showing that the person arrived in San Francisco two days ago. So it's pretty clear that this person is not an Indian but would present a danger if allowed to continue. What can the tribal officer do there? Just let the person go?
",-0.1646990329027176

I'm asking you, under the rules as they exist right now, if you don't consider them sovereign and you don't consider them acting on behalf of the government because they're not deputized, why are they subject to the Fourth Amendment?

",-0.8138434886932373
2171,19-1414,Elena_Kagan_,3139.07,3169.9," Mr. Henkel, the government relies in some significant measure on the idea of cross-enforcement authority, in other words, the belief that sovereigns generally have the power to respond to potential violations of another sovereign's laws. Are you contesting that that authority generally exists, in other words, outside the Indian context, or are you accepting that but just saying it's it's different in the Indian context?
",-0.5960710644721985
2172,19-1414,Elena_Kagan_,3233.91,3257.225," so so you're really I mean, on the the two alternatives I gave you, you're really resting on the idea that tribal authority is just different from state authority, so that even if we were to find a lot of cross-enforcement as between state officers or as between state officers and the federal government, that doesn't carry over? That's what you're saying?
",-0.1098538339138031
2173,19-1414,Neil_Gorsuch_,3333.24,3386.41," Good morning, counsel. Question for you that I actually would have liked to have gotten to with Mr. Feigin, but time didn't permit. Hopefully, you have some thoughts on it as well. Let's say just work with me for the moment. Suppose that there is some permissible role here for tribal authorities, and also suppose that in the course of a stop, that the tribal authority engages in some conduct that would violate the Constitution and that your client wanted to pursue a civil claim for that violation if if of course, in in the state context, there would be 1983; in the federal officer context, there would be Bivens. What what remedy would be available perhaps you haven't given this thought, but, if you have, I'm curious what remedy you think might be available against a tribal officer. Would there be a state law remedy? Would there be some federal remedy? What what thoughts do you have there?
",-0.775420606136322
2174,19-1414,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3467.395,3575.78," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Henkel. You make what I think are forceful separation-of-powers arguments, particularly that Congress has provided for cross-deputization, and that was not taken advantage of here. So I take that point, and that's an important one for me. But, at the same time, a couple other thoughts that I'll throw out there, and then you can react to them. The amicus brief from the former U.S. Attorneys says that ""criminal jurisdiction in Indian country is an indefensible morass of complex, conflicting, and illogical commands layered in over decades via congressional policies and court decisions and without the consent of tribal nations."" And I don't think you're going to disagree with that description necessarily, and so that leads me to think that one of the things we should be trying to do here is is to do no harm because there's lots of ripple effects from a broad decision. And with that in mind, there are statements in our decisions in Duro and Strate that really cut directly against you, as you're you're well aware. And you can say those are dicta, and that might be correct, but those have guided the law law enforcement for several decades. I think Congress and the executive could reasonably rely on those statements in the Court's decision. Certainly, the Cohen treatise treats those statements as authoritative in terms of guidance. So why isn't the best thing we can do here just to stick with what we said in those cases? It's not very analytically satisfying, but it's a narrow result that does not make a morass, as it was described, any worse. What do you think?
",0.8637843728065491
2175,19-1414,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3609.46,3639.005," Well, that's why that's why I said it's not analytically all that satisfying, but it's been out there for 30 years, and as described in the Cohen handbook, which is useful, as you you're well aware, it says, ""The Supreme Court has consistently reaffirmed the authority of tribal police to arrest offenders within Indian country and detain them until they can be turned over to the proper authorities, even if the tribe itself would lack criminal jurisdiction."" That's the black-letter description.
",0.7782787680625916
2176,19-1414,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3686.11,3769.59," I'd like to pick up where Justice Kavanaugh left off. I mean, on the one hand, as Justice Kavanaugh points out, it's not very analytically satisfying to rely on the dicta, particularly from the footnote in Strate. But I want to try this on you know, you say one problem with our you know, or the government's approach or an approach saying that there is some sort of retained authority to police here is that we haven't identified its scope or its source. But, you know, Montana and those cases that followed it relied pretty heavily on the unfairness of imposing tribal law on those who didn't participate in its creation. And in that respect, Strate's footnote is perfectly consistent with that because, as the United States pointed out in argument and in its brief, you know, Cooley and and other non-members of the tribe are represented in the creation of federal law. And so it doesn't pose that same problem here. It's it's far less of an unfairness, and Strate's footnote can be seen to be consistent with that principle, particularly if the United States is right that one way to understand Montana is that that is an instance of implied preemption that cashes out when you consider the assertion of authority to adjudicate finally civil or criminal liability or the imposition of regulations on those who didn't participate in its exercise. So can you explain to me why that would not be a way to reconcile the Strate footnote and the United States' proposed authority here?
",0.39299267530441284
2177,19-1414,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3814.32,3844.335," Okay. Well, let me let me just stop you there so I can ask this question too. Justice Thomas was asking you, you know, the same hypothetical as Mr. Cooley's stop but substituting in a serial killer. And and you said, well, if he fits the description, then maybe there might be able to be detention. And I assume that that might be an exercise of what the Ninth Circuit described as the apparent or obvious violation of law. That that's a new phrase, right? We have reasonable suspicion. We have probable cause. How do you tell if something's an apparent and obvious violation of the law?

2178,19-108,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,131.005,198.05000005," General, you've been talking about what Congress did, but, of course, the the issue comes from what the Court did. And I understand that the reference to ""punishable by death"" was was a way for Congress as sort of a shorthand for what we regard as the most serious crimes. Those are the ones that are not going to have any statute of limitations. But the Court in in Coker seemed to say that the most serious crimes, that category, punishable by death, can only include those crimes that have resulted in death and that rape can't be classified as among the most serious. Now why doesn't that determination by the Court affect how we should read the statute in this case? The reference in Article 43 refers to those punishable by death, and and those are the most serious crimes, and the Court has told us in Coker what that category can be.
",0.11690706759691238
2179,19-108,Clarence_Thomas_,320.505,342.315," Yes. General Wall, the the are you arguing that even if you could not even if you accepted Coker, for example, with respect to the punishment that could be administered, would it still apply to the statute of limitation?
",-0.9518380761146545
2180,19-108,Stephen_G_Breyer_,624.545,643.48500005," In the civil context, there are lots of numbers gathered by different groups, and there's a very long waiting period, 18 years, 15 years, between the time of of the conviction and someone actually being executed. Are there similar statistics for the military?
",-1.2471261024475098
2181,19-108,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,724.56500005,746.8," There are some canons of interpretation that may work against you in this situation, such as the principle that statutes of limitation are to be narrowly interpreted and the Rule of Lenity. Could you explain why you think the statutory language is clear enough to overcome those?
",-1.039516568183899
2182,19-108,Sonia_Sotomayor_,906.625,939.27," Mr. Wall, just to be clear, I I wasn't quite sure I understood your answer to Justice Thomas. The statute of limitations question is separate from the Coker question, isn't it? You could have a statute of limitations that is not fixed even if we were to decide that the Eighth Amendment applied to the military, correct?
",-0.5759889483451843
2183,19-108,Sonia_Sotomayor_,969.63,1029.01," That's why I I thought I wasn't quite sure. You went straight into the Coker question, and I wasn't quite sure whether you meant to answer yes or no to him. Number two, it seems to me that almost any serious crime, including an assault that causes serious physical injury, could be could be an impediment to in combat situations and create great inter- great international disputes, for example, if one soldier attacks another in a combat zone. So I I don't know why or how you have justified the explanation why death is proportionate in that situation when life without parole why life without parole wouldn't be sufficient?
",0.9937492609024048
2184,19-108,Elena_Kagan_,1133.36,1186.84," General, if I could take you back to your statutory interpretation. You've you've pointed to a number of ancillary provisions, I'll call them, and and said that they provide hints. But the main provision here is Article 43 and its statement that there the that any offense punishable by death. And that term is unqualified. You know, it doesn't say any offense punishable by death under the UCMJ, which is really how you're reading it, as if those three words were in the statute. And I'm wondering why we should read it like that. Usually, we try not to add words to a statute. So, if we say ""any offense punishable by death,"" that would suggest any offense punishable by death under any law, not just under the UCMJ.
",-0.10292977839708328
2185,19-108,Elena_Kagan_,1200.04,1212.80500005," Well, it's punishable just under anything. It it's punishable or it's not punishable. And we don't look to the source of law that tells you whether it's punishable or not. We just look to the question, can you put somebody to death for this?
",0.6182743310928345
2186,19-108,Elena_Kagan_,1241.95,1260.735," suppose this, General. Suppose that Congress passed a law tomorrow and it was not a law that was put in the UCMJ. It was in some entirely different part of the federal code, and it just said rape shall not be punished by death under any federal law. So would that change the outcome?
",-0.6494127511978149
2187,19-108,Elena_Kagan_,1280.2,1292.35," I guess the the point of the question is, if we're going to look outside the UCMJ, as in that hypothetical, you know, why stop at other parts of the U.S. Code? Why not also go to the Constitution?
",-0.38828495144844055
2188,19-108,Neil_Gorsuch_,1358.24,1386.535," Good morning, General. Let's suppose that this Court had clearly, definitively, unambiguously, absolutely held that rape punishing rape by death would would violate the Constitution in the military context, and it would not be lawfully punishable that crime would not be lawfully punishable by death. Would would would the position of the government be any different?
",-0.06164855509996414
2189,19-108,Neil_Gorsuch_,1410.14,1441.45," Separately but relatedly, the government in its brief makes a a a rather lengthy and and and and interestingly persuasive argument that Congress did not intend for the limitations period to turn on the courts' or anybody else's judgment. But I'm not sure I understand whether the the government thinks that, without reference to such inferences about congressional intent, it might prevail. Can you help me on that?
",-0.3535842299461365
2190,19-108,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1498.69,1532.96," Thank you. And good morning, General Wall. I want to follow up on your answers to Justice Kagan. I'm confused whether you think that the relevant interpretation of the statute is punishable by death under the UCMJ or punishable by death under federal statutory law. I understood you originally to be saying under the UCMJ, but then, in response to Justice Kagan, it sounded like you were broadening that out and saying punishable by death under federal statutory law.
",-0.2088480293750763
2191,19-108,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1551.94,1569.16," let me just be specific then. If Congress passed a statute outside the UCMJ that outlawed the death penalty for all federal crimes, including in the military, you would still say that that that this offense and other offenses are punishable by death under Article 43?
",-0.9385520815849304
2192,19-108,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1612.39,1634.07," That I just am curious that it doesn't say ""punishable by death under this chapter,"" and so that raises an ordinary meaning question. But I think you've answered that previously. I wanted to turn to the constitutional issue then. Do you think there's any Eighth Amendment limit on Congress's power to make offenses in the military punishable by death?
",-0.46444636583328247
2193,19-108,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1891.86,1913.105," Counsel, why would Congress want to make it impossible to prosecute rape at all after five years, no matter how heinous, no matter the consequences to military discipline or international relations, simply because this Court held that you couldn't impose the death penalty for it?

2194,19-108,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1914.84,1931.66," I I was just going to say, the the statute refers, of course, to punishable by death as as a reference. But the the two concepts, the statute of limitations and the constitutionality of capital punishment, are are two distinct concepts.
",-0.47055548429489136
2195,19-108,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1975.98,2033.375," Well, Coker, concerning the death penalty itself, and our statute here on statute of limitations, they seem particularly distinct in that none of the analysis in Coker applies at least directly to the military context. There is no societal evolution with respect to whether or not rape in the military could be punished by death, no consensus about it. In other words, the analysis in Coker seems at least consistent with the notion that the military context is continues to be distinct. So why should that judgment about the civilian context be directly applicable on a question quite different from the punishment that can be meted out, the statute of limitations question?
",-0.043403152376413345
2196,19-108,Clarence_Thomas_,2136.63,2166.38," On a separate issue, let's assume that you leave all the language in place in the in the statute, but there is a uniform policy both at the Pentagon and in the White House for many years not to call for the death penalty in the case of rape. Would that policy in some way trump the language in the statute?
",-0.806187093257904
2197,19-108,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2237.155,2266.52," Prior, there was first what seemed to be no statute of limitations. Now, suddenly, because of a case that really didn't have to do with rape I mean, it did with the death penalty in rape, but it didn't have to do with statute of limitations. Now, suddenly, the intertwining of the statutes here produces the five-year statute. Then, when they work that out, they go back to no statute of limitations. I mean, why would Congress have wanted to do that?

",-0.5842358469963074
2199,19-108,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2394.46,2413.625," So did you find something maybe the other side would be the ones to have looked for it or been able to find it where a where a lawyer in the military told his bosses, oh, you know, this is rather interesting; it brings the statute of limitations for rape back down to five years, which we've long thought it should be?

2201,19-108,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2557.99,2594.005," Throughout history, there have unfortunately been many instances in which occupying armies have gone on rape sprees and have raped many, many women in the territory that they are they are occupying.

2203,19-108,Elena_Kagan_,2730.455,2774.46," Mr. Vladeck, if I could take you back to the government's textual argument, and, as I understand it, it goes something like this: It says, if you look at Article 43 alone, there is an ambiguity there because it says ""any offense punishable by death,"" but it doesn't say punishable under what law. Is it under the code alone? Is it under all federal statutory law? Is it under the Constitution as well? It just doesn't say. And then General Wall said, so we look to surrounding context, and and we find in Article 120, in Article 18, that it supports the idea that it's really the code alone that Congress was referring to. So what's your response to that?
",-0.17661140859127045
2204,19-108,Elena_Kagan_,2824.77,2856.63," Well, why it it it seems as though you don't have all the canons on your side. On the opposite side is the canon of constitutional avoidance, that your interpretation requires courts to decide the constitutionality of a punishment at the outset of routine criminal proceedings. I mean, this is a good case where we a good example where we would have to decide how Coker and Kennedy apply to the military just to, you know, decide a a pretty routine criminal case. So doesn't that cut against you?

As I understand it and you can please do correct me if I'm mistaken both sides agree that when we're interpreting the term ""punishable by death,"" it we it nothing turns on and and and we shouldn't look to facts outside of the the the indictment or the complaint or the statute. So it doesn't matter, for example, whether the defendant himself is being charged with or whether the government seeks the death penalty or obtains it.
",0.354247123003006

2207,19-108,Neil_Gorsuch_,2964.79,2985.885," Well, let let me stop you there, because I'm not sure that quite satisfies me. Why wouldn't Congress have wanted us if you're saying Congress didn't want us to do the legal, then what what how do we know Congress didn't want us to do the factual examination outside the the the four corners of the statute and the indictment?

If if if if we agree it doesn't matter whether the individual is actually going to ever face the death penalty, let alone whether the government would even obtain it, why do we look to the constitutional requirements that's just another way of putting the same question but if if if you agree it's completely irrelevant in at least some circumstances whether whether the defendant's ever going to face the death penalty, why not in all circumstances?

2209,19-108,Neil_Gorsuch_,3077.4,3099.94," Mr. Vladeck, I have one one other question. Let's say we we disagreed with you about Coker and that we don't read it as expressly addressing the military context. Justice Kennedy thought it didn't some time ago. Let's just hypothesize that we agree with him, that it's an open question. Then then where does your argument stand?

On your Article 55 argument, which you're hanging a lot on, obviously, the government responds that Article 55's generalized bar on various punishments cannot reasonably be interpreted to forbid a punishment that the UCMJ elsewhere expressly authorizes. In other words, that reading the two provisions together, you wouldn't it wouldn't make sense at least the government argues this it wouldn't make sense to say: Oh, it's expressly authorized in as a punishment in one provision, but we're going to interpret the language in another provision to prohibit what's expressly authorized in the other provision.

2222,20-222,Sonia_Sotomayor_,840.465,898.44," Counsel, basically, what I think you're arguing is that a judge may rely on common sense and intuition in addressing whether a statement is generic so that it was unlikely to have a price impact. But how should a judge go about weighing her intuition against the opinion of experts? It seems to me, even with the hypothetical that Justice Alito posed, that what I would have done, and I think most judges would do, is to say: Gee, my gut tells me, why would this even matter? Now I've got a bunch of petitioners' experts who say no, this is why it should. And unless I can articulate why those experts' position is unreasonable, why should my instinct win? And then --

You point to two statements that suggest the Second Circuit didn't do that and neither did the district court. But it seems to me that your arguments below all centered on a point that you've given up here. You argued below that generic statements cannot have impact price impact as a matter of law.

Following up with the Chief Justice's questions on the difference between you and the other side, and other of my colleagues have also asked about this, it seems like the adjectives are going to be different and the adjectives will probably matter in future litigation, so I want to make sure I have crisply exactly what you think it should be. My understanding is that you think the generic nature of the alleged misstatement is powerful evidence of the lack of price impact. You also use ""critical"" or ""important."" What's your preferred adjective? And and do you really think the other side is agreeing with that? We'll find out soon, I guess.

So I want to see if I understand exactly what's at issue in this case because it seems to me that at the merits stage it's pretty narrow. So you and the Respondents both agree that the nature and content of the statements, here their generality, bears on the the Basic presumption and the Court ought to consider it, right?
",-0.8907443881034851
2233,20-222,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1609.08,1642.08," let me rephrase that, Mr. Shanmugam. Not only it seems to me very unlikely that any defendant in a class action like this is not going to bring in experts on the question of how the generality of this statement might have affected the price, you know, whether inflating it or, you know, causing it to spike or what have you. So the only the only dispute then is just the method of proof. I think, in the defendants' case, it would most oftenly often be both/and, like both expert evidence and common sense, but, in the Respondents' view, it should be only expert evidence and never common sense. Is that accurate?
",0.6072421669960022
2234,20-222,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1661.18,1685.965," Okay. So you started your argument by saying that this case was an opportunity for us to respore restore the promise of Halliburton II by making the Basic presumption rebuttable. Let's say that you lose on QP II. How does a ruling on that very, very narrow issue, saying, sure, judges can also consider their common sense, make the Basic presumption rebuttable?

Sometimes a statement might support the plaintiff's case and sometimes it won't. What what does that argument look like? I mean, the issue is ""we are a nice company,"" and that's one of the challenged statements. What arguments are the parties going to make?

It's filled with, if not jargon, specialized terms, I think more than are necessary, but that's just an opinion. But let me go into this. All right. I thought this first question is just like saying is a tire defective or not and you take the evidence for what it's worth. And, apparently, everybody agrees, take the evidence for what it's worth. Fine. Why isn't that the end of the case? On issue one. Mr. Shanmugam says: Well, because they made a mistake in the court of appeals. Review that. But, when I read what they said, it seemed to me that what the judge was saying is, wait a minute, suppose what the guy had said at the company was ishkabibble, total nonsense. My God, how did that move prices? Why is that material? Well, 12(b)(6), denied. Okay. Now we have to assume it's material. Now every member of the class is using the word ""ishkabibble."" So whether ""ishkabibble"" is or is not material was a matter for the judge to decide under the heading materiality. He may have made a mistake. You don't get an appeal until later. But the issue here is, are they all using the word ""ishkabibble""? Yeah, they all are, and, therefore, there's a common issue for the class. And I thought that's what the judge was talking about when he used the statements that Mr. Mr. Shanmugam referred to. Correct me insofar as I'm wrong, okay?

2238,20-222,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2241.68,2270.475," Well, maybe, maybe, but it depends on circumstances, and am I right in thinking that the real problem here is the the defendants don't get an appeal from a 12(b)(6) denial on the basis of materiality; they do get an appeal they do get an appeal when the court says this is going to be class action, and they'd like that appeal so they don't have to settle.

So the plaintiff proves whatever the plaintiff has to prove under Basic. Then the defendant, under Halliburton II, has the opportunity to introduce its evidence on this question. Then the judge has to decide. And the risk of non-persuasion is on the defendant, okay? What does the judge compare? The judge has the defendant's evidence. What does it have on the plaintiff's side? If this were a 301 presumption, I would say the judge has, on the plaintiff's side, whatever inference naturally arises from the evidence that the plaintiff has put in to satisfy Basic. And the judge would have to weigh decide how much weight to give that. Am I right? Is that what do you think that's what happens the way you see things, or do you think that Basic awards the plaintiff some quantum of proof that goes beyond the inference that naturally arises from what the plaintiff has proven?

It said exactly what you want us to say the first time. It's hard to imagine they forgot it the second time.

So, you know, at step one, Basic says that the plaintiff has a presumption that a misstatement made by the defendant affects market price. Step two, the defendant comes in and says, I have proof that it didn't in this case because it's so generic.

2247,20-222,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2939.545,2987.21999995," Good morning, Mr. Joshi. I want to think about the implications of this case for other cases. So Judge Hamilton has a very thoughtful opinion in the Seventh Circuit in Allstate where he talks about how the tension between Amgen and Halliburton II requires the district court to split some very fine hairs. It's very, very difficult to navigate because, you know, all of these questions boil down to did the statement matter, even at the certification stage, all the while, as Judge Hamilton colorfully puts it, you know, the judge is supposed to be not thinking about the pink elephant, not thinking about how any of this bears, for example, on materiality. So here's my question: The nature and content of the statement and how general it is, do you think that is essentially a question of materiality?
",0.5025745630264282
2248,20-222,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3021.515,3047.435," You know, but, as Justice Breyer said earlier, it's very difficult. You think about price impacts, and you think about this distinction, and I agree you can make a logical distinction between what actually happened in price impact and what a reasonable how a reasonable investor would react, which would be more the materiality question, but they're very close, right? I mean, if a question if if a statement is immaterial, it's it's far less likely that it will actually have an impact on the price, right?

Your the Petitioners say that under the court of appeals' holding this is a quote from page 5 of their their brief, ""Plaintiffs need only identify a drop in a company's stock price following a negative event, then assert that the stock price had been improperly maintained by a company's generic statements, without having to show when or how the inflation entered the company's stock price.""

And I and maybe on rebuttal the others I mean, this seems like an area that the more that I read about it, the less that we write, the better based on very peripheral issues. And in this instance, you're so much in agreement. Why what what do you think about our not answering the question?

2252,20-222,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3556.46,3578.495," Well, you just told us we should say don't reintroduce the materiality issue. Do you mean to say that we should provide the following instruction: In considering whether the Basic presumption has been rebutted, you may not consider any evidence that would also go to the issue of materiality?
",-0.5114367604255676
2253,20-222,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3580.4,3594.62," should we say the opposite of that? That there is no that there is no reason to disregard evidence that goes to price impact that would rebut the Basic presumption just because it would also go to the issue of materiality.

And it's hard to find in the second opinion the correct statement of the law. You have to go back to the first opinion to find the correct statement of the law.

I mean, suppose there were expert reports on the question of, you know, how generic these statements are and whether they could have a price impact regardless, and the judge says, you know, I've been looking at these reports and I've been getting bleary-eyed, and there seem am there seem to be ambiguities, there seem to be gaps, and I'm going to fill that in with my gut intuition of what really matters to investors in the real world.

2258,20-222,Neil_Gorsuch_,4172.265,4262.555," Good morning, Mr. Goldstein. You know, as I understand it, you know, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that this is a class that needs to be certified. Then comes in a presumption as part of that that a misstatement of fact affects price because of the efficient market theory. Fine. Then the defendant comes forward with direct evidence saying, well, in this case, this misstatement did not affect price. And the question then is, what what happens next? And it seems to me one of two things could happen. One, the plaintiff can come forward with evidence, as you did here, trying to rebut that direct evidence and say, uh-uh, you're wrong, that that that, here, it did, in fact, affect price. And and and you may carry your burden of proof and win the day. The other alternative, though, is, if we flip the burden and put it on the defendant here, the plaintiff might be able to do nothing and just rest on the presumption that there's a price impact in the face of direct evidence that there wasn't, and then the district judge is, where Justice Alito worried about, he's weighing direct evidence of no price impact versus a theory, a presumption. And I'm not sure I understand how a district judge can do that. And isn't that some evidence that we should require, consistent with Rule 301, that the defendant carry his burden, as you say as you say you did here, of showing that the direct evidence isn't to be credited and that the presumption should win out as a result?

So I think, you know, there's been a lot of discussion today about how much daylight there is between you and the Petitioners on QP 1. And you say that it's the Petitioners' fault that they forfeited this argument, that it's different than what they did in the Second Circuit. But it seems to me that you've both moved towards the middle. I mean, they've backed off on how important they think generality is and whether it can be decided categorically. But you've also conceded that generality is relevant, and you've given on the common sense, on the role of the court's common sense. So now we are left, you know, in this position where you've both moved more closely together, and now we have to decide what to do about the Second Circuit's opinion. Don't you think, Mr. Goldstein, that it might be helpful, given the positions that you've both taken, to make clear that language like this in the Second Circuit's opinion where it says ""whether alleged misstatements are too general to demonstrate price impact has nothing to do with the issue of whether common questions predominate over individual ones,"" so whether that's you know, you called it you know, maybe their literary effort needed to be polished a bit, I mean, no matter what the cause, don't you think it would be worth our while in clarifying what the standard is that you now both appear to agree on?

What is your best argument, in your opinion, against what I think is the other side's argument, we're looking at the statute, the relevant words since government is a defined term, the statute authorizes appropriate relief against any official or other person acting under color of law, all right? That's the relevant words. And there's lots of cases that say many cases that appropriate relief can, in appropriate cases, include monetary relief. Of course, if the person has sovereign immunity of some kind, then you can't sue them. That's Sossamon. But there's no sovereign immunity here, end of case, all right. Now what's your best answer to that, in your opinion?
",-0.027950245887041092
2267,19-71,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,643.09,702.73," Let me pick up on what you just said. The term ""government"" is defined to include an official but also ""other person acting under color of law."" And you say that a person who is exercising a private entity or a private person exercising government authority would constitute a person acting under color of law, such as the operator of a a private company operating a a prison. So, if a person acting under a person acting under color of law who is not a government official can only be sued in a personal capacity, and if that person can be sued in a personal capacity, why should we infer that an official can only be sued in an official capacity and not a personal capacity?
",-0.46175023913383484
2268,19-71,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,787,809.44500005," And one one other question. Respondent emphasizes the fact that if it if it prevails, federal officials who are sued in a personal capacity would be able to assert a defense of qualified immunity. Now, if if if that is right, if we say that in the opinion, how will the federal government be harmed?

2269,19-71,Sonia_Sotomayor_,856.9,918.765," As I read the briefs on both sides, each of you rely on legislative history to some extent. And I know some of my colleagues don't believe in doing that. But assume humor me, please. You don't have to make a disclaimer about its use. One of the things that concerns me greatly is that RFRA was very concerned, at least Congress was, with the many families whose loved ones were being subjected to autopsies, in violation of their religious beliefs, and, in fact, there was a lot of testimony before Congress about the fact that injunctive relief would not help those families. So, if that was one of the concerns of this legislation, as is many other actions by government officials that might violate religious beliefs, why do you think Congress would have intended to preclude money damages against individual actions that violated religious belief?
",0.7271860837936401
2270,19-71,Sonia_Sotomayor_,948.45,967.29," Mr. Kneedler, isn't the overall thrust to give a cause of action a claim and a remedy? That's the stated purpose of the Act under the terms of the Act. Why would Congress take away from appropriate relief the only relief that could help some people for the --
",-0.38405829668045044
2271,19-71,Elena_Kagan_,1059.71,1103.245," Mr. Kneedler, when Congress passed RFRA, the legislation applied to states and localities, as well as to the federal government. We changed that, this Court did, in in Boerne. But it was clear in the original legislation that Congress meant it to apply to states and localities. And I think nobody disputes that prior to Smith, private citizens could seek damages under 1983 against state and local officials in their personal capacity for violating the Free Exercise Clause. So, under the law as originally enacted, do you think that plaintiffs could sue state and local officials in their personal capacities for damages?
",-0.6700097322463989
2272,19-71,Elena_Kagan_,1143.495,1169.085," So doesn't that seem odd to you, Mr. Kneedler? Because now you're saying that Congress passed this law that actually contained fewer remedies against state and local officials than the pre-Smith law did. And I thought that the whole point of RFRA was essentially to expand protection for religious liberty. Now you're saying that, in this provision, it effectively contracted it.

2273,19-71,Neil_Gorsuch_,1242.45,1271.82," struggling with the language of of the definitional provision that's most immediately before us. As I understand it, the government has agreed, albeit on page 41-42 in Footnotes 6 and 7 of its brief, that the phrase ""other person acting under color of law"" does permit suits for damages against private persons, like the government contractor. Is that right?
",-0.8637295365333557
2274,19-71,Neil_Gorsuch_,1272.585,1307.005," Okay. And if that's the case, why wouldn't the same be true of officials, the the last antecedent that that parenthetical clause appears to modify? I understand the government's argument that ""department, agencies, and instrumentalities"" are before earlier in in in the line. But, of course, none of those involves an individual who could even possibly be sued in an individual capacity. The only one that might is ""official."" And and that's the one that's right before the modifying clause in the parenthetical. Help me with that.
",-0.2264556735754013
2275,19-71,Neil_Gorsuch_,1411.87,1449.515," Okay, all right. So we're back to ""appropriate."" And for there, I guess I just want to follow up quickly on on Justice Breyer's question, which is I understand that back in the day when there were forms of action that came with limited kinds of relief, but with the merger of law and equity sometime ago, courts have been allowed to provide any kind of relief available, appropriate to the circumstances. And I don't think the government's arguing that Congress meant to ever allow or might allow inappropriate relief to the circumstances. So how does that word carry all the weight you want it to?

2276,19-71,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1498.52,1542.57," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Kneedler. In thinking about what the text means here, I look at the words but also look at the words that aren't there. And this is a relatively short and heavily-focused-upon statute by Congress at the time. And when it says ""appropriate relief,"" it does not, of course, say appropriate injunctive relief. And it's hard to imagine that that didn't escape the attention of the members of Congress who were focused on this. What what do you say in response to that argument about the missing words after ""appropriate"" that would have limited it in the way that Justice Gorsuch was just asking about as well?
",-0.025647085160017014
2277,19-71,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1957.595,1989.815," Well, just to just to interrupt you briefly there, I think the argument against that, again, putting the parenthetical to one side, is that the term being defined is ""the government,"" and the list of entities you have there leading up to ""official"" are all governmental entities, branch, department, agency, instrumentality. So I think, again, without the parenthetical, it's almost there's a very compelling case for the idea that the official there is subject to suit in his official capacity.

2279,19-71,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2211.91,2287.92999995," I I have one question about one of your opponent's arguments. Look at the phrase ""person acting under color of law."" Now that's the key phrase for you, certainly. That suggests, particularly if you look back to similar language in 1983, that a personal action lies. But this whole statute, RFRA, is really an effort to put into statutory form a certain kind of constitutional interpretation that Smith, in fact, rejected. And there was a lot of concern in Congress. There would have been no personal action if they had maintained the older interpretation of the First Amendment. So why would Congress want to have the personal action here when they never could have had it if what Congress would have thought was the right view of the of the religious Free Exercise Clause had been maintained in in the Constitution? In other words, this is like a constitutional statute. No Bivens action then. Why should there be one now?

So the statute would authorize would would say that a person may assert that a a claim or a defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain relief against the government.

Could the district court in in your case or in any other case say, in the exercise of my discretion, I think that damages should not be available in a case like this, and, therefore, I'm not going to allow the jury I'm not going to submit that question to the jury?
",-0.34443199634552
2282,19-71,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2521.28,2565.89," Counsel, Petitioners argue that you haven't identified any statute in which the phrase ""appropriate relief"" was interpreted to include a damages remedy against federal officials, absent some extra text making the availability of damages explicit. Is that right? And if it is, can you theorize for me why that's so? Is it because courts have held the opposite, because courts haven't considered the question, or because there just aren't that many statutes that authorize appropriate relief against federal government officials?
",-0.8815268874168396
2283,19-71,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2636.6,2668.345," I'm sorry. Are you taking the position that Congress didn't intend, by using appropriate relief, to include before Sossamon to include states and their their their officials? I mean, there were private causes of action under 1983 for damages against the state government and its officials. Why would Congress not have wanted to pierce sovereign immunity with respect to states and their officials back then?

2284,19-71,Elena_Kagan_,2719.46,2776.44," Mr. Kassem, if I could just follow up on Justice Sotomayor's first question. As I understood your answer, you said well, RFRA is a very special statute, a super-statute. But assume that I don't think that for the moment. Assume that I don't think that RFRA has any special interpretive rules attached to it, that I think it should be interpreted the same way other statutes are. And then I come back to what Justice Sotomayor said, which is that we don't see any statutes, and, certainly, we haven't interpreted any statutes, with this little specificity to permit damages against federal employees personally. So the question is, why shouldn't we take that as as signaling what we should do here, that we should say, you know, Congress really has to be clear to do this, and Congress hasn't been so clear?
",0.2297077178955078
2285,19-71,Elena_Kagan_,2846.38,2868.795," Well, if I could interrupt you on that point. I mean I I definitely the first, but I thought the Franklin was really limited to where Congress was silent on the question of remedies. Congress is not silent on the question of remedies here. We have a question about how to interpret what it said about remedies, but it specifically spoke to remedies. So why is Franklin at all applicable?
",-0.016935445368289948
2286,19-71,Neil_Gorsuch_,2932.48,2980.20500005," Good morning. I I'd like to follow up on Justice Kagan's line of questioning. I guess I'm I'm equally befuddled by the reliance on Franklin and a lot of the Bivens line of cases involving implications and presumptions. Here Congress expressly stated that appropriate relief may be awarded, spoke directly to remedies. And I I would have thought there might have been an argument along the lines of that that language refers courts to the law of remedies. And since the merger of law and equity, we don't have causes of action that are limited in the nature of their remedies to specific forms of relief. Could you comment on that?
",0.4681972861289978
2287,19-71,Neil_Gorsuch_,3070.615,3098.98," So it would be sufficient for your purposes to if we wrote an opinion simply saying we're not relying on any presumptions of any kind anywhere. We're looking at the text, the text refers us to law of remedies, the law of remedies today is a distinct area of transsubstantive law, and it's unhinged from any particular form or cause of action the way it used to be, and it allows the courts discretion to form sufficient relief to make a person whole.

2288,19-71,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3118.89,3176.76," The first problem I have here, a concern, is just the mismatch between RFRA and the kind of suits we're talking about. You're suing, I think, still up around 15 special agents of the FBI. There's no mens rea requirement as you indicated to Justice Thomas. And they can be subject to liability under RFRA under your theory for enforcing a generally applicable law and subjects to damages, liability in their individual capacities. That seems an just an odd mismatch, no mens rea, generally applicable law, damages in their individual capacities and we're talking about FBI special special agents here. What's your response to that concern?

And thinking about appropriate, I think we think about what are the circumstances here. And it's very odd, I think, without a mens rea that it encompasses generally applicable and subjects, you know, career FBI agents to life-altering damages remedies. And there and just to be clear, I know there's strong interests on both sides here. I'm just trying to make sure we cover what will happen to the special agents as well.

I want to ask one other question, which is going to the text. It's not clear, the text, on what's encompassed within appropriate relief. The question's whether does that include damages or not include damages. It doesn't say appropriate injunctive relief. It doesn't refer specifically to damages. So we have to figure out what the silence means. And on in thinking about that, and not only do I think about the circumstances I just mentioned, but every statute authorizing damages actions against federal employees or officers in their personal capacities does so expressly and mentions damages. I think this would be a first or among a very small handful where damages were awarded against federal officers in their individual capacities without the statute explicitly saying so.

2291,142-orig,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,126.76,169.12," Mr. Garre, how should we analyze the case if we think based on the record that Georgia contributed to the collapse of the oyster harvest but not enough to cause that on its own, that the situation is like that on ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" a lot of things took a stab at the fishery: drought, overharvesting, Florida regulatory policies, but also lower salinity that was caused by Georgia's use of the water. But you can't say that any one of those things is responsible for for killing the the fishery. How how should we analyze the case from that perspective?

2293,142-orig,Clarence_Thomas_,297.56,341.56," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Garre, a couple of questions. You you say that Georgia has influenced the reduction in flow. Could you give us a before and after? You seem to suggest in your in your briefs that an increase of above 6,000 cubic feet per second would be beneficial to the oyster beds, and but there's much discussion about the Corps limiting the flow to 5,000 square cubic feet feet per second during the low flow and drought periods. Could you give us a sense of when there was a flow that was above 5,000 and when did that reduction occur, and what role does the Corps play in the reduction during the drought and dry period being at 5,000?

2294,142-orig,Clarence_Thomas_,431.92,465.4," Well, that's you know, that's interesting because one of the problems we had during the dry and drought period before was that the Corps under its manual and its operate its operating manual had a tendency to hold water behind the dams and only allow 5,000 cubic feet per second. The I don't know, what would what would you do, what could the Corps do, within the confines of its current operating manual to accommodate what you're asking for?

Of course, one is all these a lot of people testified or some testified, experts, that there was overharvesting of the oysters, and that was the major cause. That's your basic problem. The other, which I don't understand too well, which I'd appreciate your clarifying first, I assume your experts went out and they said, this is how much water falls in Georgia or comes into Georgia every year, and we'll subtract from that the water that evaporates, and we end up with a number that they must be using, and that's a lot. And the other side says, well, let's go out and measure what they're actually using. And they went and measured it, and that was a little. And between the two, there's a lot of disappearing water. Where does it go? And why? I mean, you have the burden of clear and convincing evidence. So, if the Special Master, and we looked through the record, adequately supported if it is, that they didn't use that much water. How do you get around that?

2296,142-orig,Stephen_G_Breyer_,635.88,672.8," Well, what is the evidence? Give me your best evidence. I mean, you have you you you have some oyster fishermen who went out and said, hey, there are a lot of dead oysters around here. And if we overharvested them, why are there all these dead oysters? Because they're in somebody's stomach but not on the reefs or not out here. And but the other side says there are not that many and the water wasn't that saline and there are a few more conches but not too many, and you did overharvest the oysters after the oil spill particularly because you thought get them now or never. So we have conflicting evidence.

2298,142-orig,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,770.88,812," All right. To follow up on the point that Justice Breyer was was exploring, which is the cause of the collapse of the oyster beds, there's conflicting evidence. You have evidence from Dr. Berrigan and Mr. Ward. The other side has evidence from its expert, Dr. Lipcius. But what about hard scientific evidence about salinity? What is the maximum salinity for healthy oyster beds, what was the salinity in 2012 at the time of the collapse, what is it today, et cetera?

2300,142-orig,Sonia_Sotomayor_,945.16,1027.4," Counsel, my biggest problem with your case are three facts, all offered by your experts. First, Dr. Greenblatt modeled that without any water consumption by Georgia, salinity would have changed by one to eight parts per thousand but generally less than five ppts. Then you have Dr. Kimbro, who he relied on, and his experiments show that to see any appreciable effect on predation, you need salinity changes of 5 to 15 ppts. And then you have Dr. White, who predicted that if Georgia had not consumed any water, oyster biomass in 2012 would have been 7 to 10 percent higher. I'm doubtful that a 10 percent change is sufficient to be viewed as an invasion of rights of a serious magnitude. It's hard to to imagine how water consumption that at most, by your own experts, contributed less than 10 percent to your problem, to Florida's problem, how would that justify the use of an equitable remedy?

Why should the Special Master or us be bound by the testimony of an expert who takes tests at the best part of the river for her and for her conclusions and doesn't at the parts where she says it's a greater effect?
",-0.2676220238208771
2302,142-orig,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1115.8,1155.52," but let me ask you a further question on this, you know, this one ppt change, which, in the east bay, as as she testified, it's about 10 percent. But I don't know where the expert testimony is that 6 ppts, as opposed to 5, is bad for oysters or is what caused the the issue the the decrease here. Your own experts, Dr. Kimbro and Dr. White, said that at least 12 or 15 ppts is actually optimal for oysters.
",-0.5895382761955261
2303,142-orig,Elena_Kagan_,1184.4,1210.48," Mr. Garre, you said a while ago that Florida would benefit from as little as 500 CFS. And I didn't get that in your briefs. You know, in your briefs, it didn't seem to me that you made an argument that less than 1,000 CFS would make any difference in the bay. So where is this 500 coming from? What's the evidence that you have that 500 CFS would matter?
",-0.47846025228500366

Judge Kelly found that the decree would cost about 100 million dollars a year in drought years for Georgia on the one hand and that the entire oyster fishery generates about 6.6 million dollars a year before the collapse.

I have a question about what showing you're required to make at this stage about the Corps' what role the Corps would have in ensuring that extra water went to Florida even assuming that we impose this cap of 1,000 cubic feet per second. I mean, last time around, the Court said that the Special Master had required too much and too soon, essentially, from you with respect to the proof of what the Corps would do. Specifically, what more have you shown this time around? Because now the other findings that Special Master Lancaster did not make have been made. So have you done anything additional to show what the Corps could do to accommodate?

Most of your brief and most of your argument has focused on Georgia's agricultural uses. So are you abandoning any challenge to municipal use?
",-0.9991480112075806
2311,142-orig,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1901.96,1925.2," Okay. And, similarly, briefs and oral argument have focused primarily on the effects of Georgia's consumption on the oyster industry. It seemed to me that your evidence of effects on the wildlife and plant life as a result of the consumption was pretty weak, that you didn't show a reduction in species. So am I correct that you're really primarily focused simply on the harms to the oyster industry?

Even if you're not a sufficient cause, how do you analyze the case if we conclude the record supports the idea that you were a contributing cause? In other words, are you off the hook if you alone did not cause the harm to the fishery?

2315,142-orig,Clarence_Thomas_,2351.56,2369.68," So the when reading the Florida's brief, if I were to entitle it, it would be something along the lines of ""The Case of the Disappearing Water."" And if that is accurate, where do you think it went if Georgia is not the source of that disappearance?
",-1.6340147256851196
2316,142-orig,Clarence_Thomas_,2422.04,2474.16," And I I'd like to go back to something else, taking my lead from Justice Alito's question. When we had this case the last time, the Special Master Lancaster focused on redressability, and, of course, the Court thought that we should go beyond that, and but there are pieces of his findings or portions that suggest that Georgia, particularly the agricultural area, caused some harm, and Judge Kelly now seems to come out the other way. And the question is I think Justice Alito's question is appropriate what do we do with that, with that in apparent inconsistency?
",-0.42457807064056396
2317,142-orig,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2544.96,2608.44," Well, I have two questions and one totally irrelevant question. The first was Justice Thomas's. How can there be these big discrepancies in how you measure this water that's being used by Georgia? I mean, huge discrepancies. I don't understand that. Anything you want to say further, fine. And the second is, how can there be these oysters all over the place and they go out and look and there are load loads of dead oysters all over, and they say, well, actually, no, it's overfishing that caused it all? Well, if you overfish, then you catch them. And my third question, which is absolutely irrelevant, this has been going on for years, and Florida thinks that it wouldn't cost Georgia much to remedy the situation. Maybe Georgia has a different view. But has anybody ever tried to work out a that Florida would pay something to Georgia to solve the problem? Has anybody ever tried is only my question there. You don't have to answer it if you don't want to, but the first two I'd like to know.

2318,142-orig,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2729.84,2794.96," If we think there's some harm to Florida, but the imposition of the decree would cause harm to Georgia, what do we do with with that data? If it's just a matter of calculating the dollar value of Georgia agriculture and the Florida oyster and seafood industry, that's pretty straightforward. But Mr. Garre appropriately mentions that what is at stake is a precious ecosystem. So how do we take that into account? And in answering that, maybe you could answer this this question: To what degree are these oyster beds a natural phenomenon and to what degree are they a man-made creation? Was something like this present when Ponce de Leon sailed up, or is this something that oyster farmers have created?

2319,142-orig,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2933.8,3021.72," Counsel, you're talking about taking out agriculture, but your brother on the other side points out that many of the conservation methods are at no cost. So, for example, you've made great strides in in improving irrigation efficiency. I see that in the record. But I also understand that half of Georgia's irrigation permits impose no limit whatsoever on how much water farmers can draw out of the ground or, once they do, whether they're overwatering. Now, whether or not 80 percent are not overwatering, there's still 20 percent that are. There has been a significant proof of more use by the farmers. I'm I'm just not sure how we can ignore the fact that there are measures that would not be costly that would only require that you do something about your grandfathered permits so that there are limits put in and limits that are related to need rather than open-ended. Why should we ignore that those conservation methods would come at no cost?

I mean, suppose that we had what you think is a different case than this one but a case where it was clear that Georgia was overconsuming water and it was clear that that that if that water was able to get down to Florida, Florida would be much benefited. But then suppose that we had no reason to believe that the water would get down to Florida because of the Corps' operations. How would we think about that kind of case?

I want to pick up on Justice Alito's question with respect to the balancing and the substantially outweigh test that you articulate. You say that the potential benefits must substantially outweigh the harm and that that needs to be shown by clear and convincing evidence, as I understand your argument. And I think one of the big responses is how do you explain New York versus New Jersey, and that's certainly in the briefs and again Mr. Garre today has said, well, if you took that analysis and really applied it in the same way that Georgia's articulating here, then New York versus New Jersey would have come out the other way.

So Special Master Kelly seems to have concluded that a modest injury and and it, you know, put the injury to Florida from Georgia's actions at about 1.4 percent of a decrease in oyster biomass that a modest injury didn't justify an equitable decree, that the injury had to be serious. And I want to know if that's the right legal way to look at it. And I'll let me put it to you this way: What if the injury was, in fact, modest, but it would be virtually costless to Georgia to remedy it? Would we still say that that wouldn't justify an equitable decree? So was Judge Kelly right to say that a modest injury doesn't justify an equitable decree?
",-0.319269597530365
2327,142-orig,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3640.44,3691.64," Let me I want to follow up on it's related to this question, but it follows up on one of Justice Alito's, which was asking you to measure the harm to an ecosystem. So, you know, here, you said earlier that the larger state doesn't always win. And, of course, if we're looking just at the dollar value of Georgia's agricultural industry versus the dollar value of Florida's oyster injury industry, we would say, you know, as as Judge Kelly did, let's just assume those figures were right, that the benefit the cost to Georgia dwarfs the benefit to Florida. But how do we put a price on I mean, let's let's imagine and I know you disagree with this, but let's just imagine that Georgia could take measures that cost less and help Georgia help Florida preserve the Apalachicola oysters. How how do we put a price on an environmental benefit like that?

My factual question is this: The the police went to the porch and they went inside and they took your client and took him to the hospital, I think, and then they went back and got the guns. How long after they put him in the ambulance or wherever they put him how long afterwards did they get the gun --

Sure, I think you could apply exigent circumstances. Then I think, wait a minute, there there's so many situations where it's obvious the police should enter. You know, a baby's been crying for five hours, nobody seems to be around. A rat's come out of the house at a time when rats carry serious disease and have to be stopped. A person goes into the house that the police think, but they think the go inside the house and don't know that this person has a serious communicable disease, particularly for older people who happen to live in the house. I mean, we all can think of dozens of instances, and if we call those exigent circumstances, we weaken the exigent circumstances. And if we move to a whole new thing like caretaker, I don't know what we do. So what's your answer to my dilemma legally? Say exigent circumstances, but there's special ones or what? How do we do it?
",0.5093448758125305
2337,20-157,Stephen_G_Breyer_,702.23,721.745," Too narrow, because there are lots of health emergencies. What about, you know, the rats, the baby crying, the old people who don't know they're going to be exposed to deadly viruses, et cetera?

In Camara, it was a it was a it was a a a long term, it was a different thing. Okay. I'm trying to put my dilemma, and I want your answer.

2339,20-157,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,804.795,877.88," Mr. Dvoretzky, I I think the way in which this case has been presented to us by both sides is most unhelpful because it conflates several separate issues. One is whether a warrant is needed under certain circumstances. I know that's what you want to talk about. I want to put that aside and talk about a a an issue that comes before that, and that is, what are the permissible reasons for a search or seizure and the amount of evidence that a government officer has to have to to conduct the search or seizure? And so what I'd like to do is to try to give you some situations and ask you to tell us as briefly as you possibly can whether a search would be permitted under these circumstances and the amount of information that would be needed for a non-consensual search by some government officer, also putting aside the question of whether it's a police officer or somebody else. So the first one is a person in the house may commit suicide where suicide is not a crime. Is that a permissible reason for a search?

A vulnerable a vulnerable person in the house, for example, a a person with a disability, an elderly person with dementia, a child, may be abused or denied necessary care.

You have a neighbor who expects an elderly woman to come visit, a known tipster who comes and tells the police she's never late, and it's now she's really late and there's no answer. I don't see how, under any circumstance, either the emergency aid or emergency doctrine, exigent circumstance doctrine wouldn't permit that search. I I I'm if that's the case, then maybe Justice Breyer is right, but, if I disagree with him and believe that both the emergency aid doctrine and the exigent circumstance doctrines would permit most entries that where there is reasonable cause to believe that someone might be in need, what does that do to your argument?

But my point to you is, aren't you trying to break you're right that the community caretaking exception was created because of some of these hypotheticals, but I think, at at the core and I thought that was your argument is that there has to be some sense of imminency, some sense that there's a real problem going on, correct?

I mean, what what what does the government do that doesn't involve health or safety? How does it help to have an administrative warrant requirement? I I mean, I understand the common law requires treated the home as an asylum and a castle of defense that was virtually impenetrable, absent some sort of immediate concern about physical injuries, as you describe it in your brief. But, if the government can just get an administrative warrant to come in to test for illness, to check the temperature of the house, whether it's too hot, too cold, maybe to install some energy-saving devices because that helps health or safety, if that's what you're now conceding, what's left of the Fourth Amendment?

You know, you're talking about finding a neutral decisionmaker, and you're and, you know, you cite the line in your brief about police being engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime. What if, you know and and some communities are doing that because sometimes mental health checks don't go so well and people end up getting hurt or the police, after someone who's mentally ill pulls a gun on the police or a knife, things go very poorly and sometimes the person who is the subject of the welfare check winds up being hurt or killed. So some some communities are creating a situation where social workers go in. Would that be reasonable? Do you need to have an administrative scheme or an administrative warrant or something like that?

But you're saying exigent exigent circumstances are nothing, no matter which government official is making that judgment?
",-0.0016417060978710651
2361,20-157,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2236.54,2266.26," Okay. Then let me ask you about the kinds of administrative schemes that you're imagining. It it sounds odd to my ears to talk about probable cause to think that someone would benefit from help, right? We've used the probable cause requirement to talk about probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. Are there circumstances where probable cause or reasonable position reasonable suspicion, those sorts of standards, have been used outside of the investigative context when we're talking about crime?
",-0.029744140803813934
2362,20-157,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2284.12,2303.165," Well, housing code violations sound different to me. You know, you have probable cause to believe that there's been some sort of violation, even if it's not criminal. It sounds odd to me to apply that probable cause standard to the kinds of situations that the Chief Justice or Justice Kavanaugh were positing, where you have an elderly person who needs help. There's no violation.

2363,20-157,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2515.39,2537.915," Let's suppose, Mr. Desisto, that police get a call from a from a neighbor who says, you know, the Johnsons are away, I I know they're not here, and they've got this fence around their backyard, it's it's locked, but there's a cat up in the tree. Can you can you come and help, you know, get the cat down? Is that community caretaking?
",-0.08948457986116409
2364,20-157,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2565.21,2589.055," Well, at common law and under our cases, the interests protected by the Fourth Amendment, I think, are a little more significant than that. And, you know, the backyard surrounded by a locked fence is is entitled to protection as well. You know, a mere cat caught in a tree, I mean, you leave it there for a while, it'll probably come down on its own.

2365,20-157,Clarence_Thomas_,2624.73,2658.1," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Counsel, would you when I look back at the cases that led to this and then that Cady relied on, they were all cases involving impounded or wrecked cars. How did we get from that to to this case, where the no warrant is required to enter a private home as opposed to searching an impounded car?
",-1.5850023031234741
2366,20-157,Clarence_Thomas_,2693.78,2754.71," Well, that you know, that's I I don't want to I'm sorry for cutting you off, but just this point. Here's my point, that in Cady, Chief Justice Rehnquist first posits that there is a warrant requirement, and we normally say that the Fourth Amendment standard, when it comes to the home requirements of the Fourth Amendment are met with a warrant when it comes to the home. But he says this sentence, he writes this sentence: ""One class of cases which constitutes at least at least a partial exception to this general rule is automobile searches."" That sounds to me as though that's an exception to the general requirement for a warrant. And and I'm trying to figure out how you got from this case to the general case, to the case that he said to the general rule. You got from the exception to the general rule, and I don't understand how we did that.
",0.2104020118713379
2367,20-157,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2805.535,2903.67," My question my problem is that if you take a caretaker exception and read that into the word ""reasonable,"" there's no stopping. We don't know how far we'll go. But, if you are absolute, you may cause a different problem. So we're looking for subsidiary standards. Camara says you need a warrant for administrative searches, but it uses words like ""normally"" and so forth, so there's some wiggle room there. What about would you what would you think of the standard that Rhode Island wrote into its law? That you'd write we'd write a case that has to do with suicide threats, period. The American Psychological Association says you must take those threats seriously. That's what we're writing about, the common law approach, this case. Rhode Island says any police officer they wrote this statute after this case began any police officer can take an individual into protective custody and so forth if the officer has reason to believe he is in need of immediate care and treatment and there would be a risk of serious harm by reason of mental disability if he's allowed liberty. What about that? If the officer has reason to believe that there is a an imminent likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental disability. Suppose we said, well, for this case, that is a reasonable standard.
",0.29706117510795593
2368,20-157,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2961.74,2982.78," Well, the question before the Court is caretaker. We say no. That exception is an automobile exception, that's what we said, but that doesn't mean there's no exception. There are emergencies, et cetera, and as applied to a person who's a suicide threat, Rhode Island's law does come up with a reasonable standard that we think does not violate the the Fourth Amendment.
",0.4022442102432251
2369,20-157,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3010.48,3061.415," Counsel, one of the things that is troubling to a lot of people about the caretaking exception is that it doesn't seem to have any clear boundaries. And when you tell us that it can include getting a cat down from a tree, that fortifies that concern. So can we narrow this down? Let's talk about the reasons why a search may be conducted or a seizure may be conducted, and, again, putting aside the issue of a warrant, can we narrow it down to preventing life-threatening injury or serious injury or some definable quantity of property damage? Do you think it's possible to give it some structure in any of those ways?
",0.1521461457014084
2370,20-157,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3132.28,3149.36," Well, it's a calculation of probability, but it's a you know, it's not a it's not an overwhelming requirement, but it's a pretty substantial requirement. ""Reasonable suspicion"" has a clear meaning. It could be applied in a lot of different contexts. Is that what you're advocating?
",0.0412367507815361
2371,20-157,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3173.285,3306.155," Counsel, I think that Justice Alito hit the nail on the head, because I've read the decisions of other circuits. They seem all to have different factors that make up community caretaking, and I'm actually not sure what it means. But I am concerned deeply about the First Circuit's claim that there is no requirement that officers must select the least intrusive means of fulfilling care community caretaking responsibilities. I think what everyone has forgotten here is that, at least in this situation, there was no immediate danger to the person threatening suicide and no immediate danger to the wife because the suicide person was removed to a hospital. And so the issue is, can the police, notwithstanding that and notwithstanding the ability to ask the wife whether she would consent to giving up the gun and ammunition, that they decided on their own to go in and seize the gun. That appears to me to take away from any of the limiting principles that Justice Alito put forth, yes, some some whether you call it reasonable suspicion, some some suspicion, whatever adjective you put there, there was no immediate danger, there were a readily accessible alternative that was ignored, and you're putting into the hands of law enforcement the ability to use their judgment as opposed to that of the psychiatrists who were treating this man, they certainly could have asked the psychiatrists whether they should remove the guns or not. They didn't do anything. Tell me, what's the limiting principles?

2372,20-157,Sonia_Sotomayor_,3307.21,3330.3," Or how how serious does the threat have to be? How much judgment do the police officers have to be how do we limit them from substituting their own? Could they have gone into the house and taken not just the gun but any bat, knife, anything else that in their judgment this man could have used to commit suicide?
",-0.569665253162384
2373,20-157,Elena_Kagan_,3389.835,3420.32," Mr. Desisto, I I would think that if the police have some good reason to think that a person is going to use a gun or other weapon to take his own life or to take to take his own life or to take the life of a spouse or other family member, that would count as reason enough for the police to proceed. In other words, it is an exigent circumstances or you can say it falls within the exception that we've set up for emergency aid. So why didn't you make that argument?
",0.2743745446205139
2374,20-157,Elena_Kagan_,3490.31,3522.44," Yeah. No, I mean, I guess I understand why that would seem like community caretaking. That sounds like a phrase that covers a lot of stuff. But, as Justice Thomas says, we really have only used that phrase with respect to automobile inventories, inventory searches, and you said, well, the Fourth Amendment has only one test, but I kind of think, if there's any one principle of the Fourth Amendment law that this Court has created, it's that the home is special and that the automobile is distinctly not.
",0.6834982633590698
2375,20-157,Neil_Gorsuch_,3548.78,3584.725," Mr. Desisto, at common law at least, you know, when we look we often look to common law when we're interpreting the Fourth Amendment, its reasonableness requirement, what did it mean then, people could, of course, trespass on property in aid of a public or private necessity, what we today call exigent circumstances. I'm unable to locate any common law authority privileging a trespass absent exigent something like exigent circumstances. Have you been able to locate anything in the common law that comes close to what you're asking for here?
",-0.28043332695961
2376,20-157,Neil_Gorsuch_,3609.96,3650.585," Okay. If the if the original meaning and history doesn't help, let let let me ask you why I'm kind of following up on Justice Kagan real quickly here. I would have thought that cases of of threatened violence against oneself or others or the prospect that someone is lying, having fallen in a home, would count as exigent circumstances in the vast majority of cases, and it's only when there's a long time delay that that's going to become a problem. So why why why doesn't the exigent circumstances bucket take care of the practical concerns that have been voiced here today?
",0.4503004550933838
2377,20-157,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3682.565,3728.14," Thank you. And good morning, Mr. Desisto. Picking up right there on Justice Gorsuch's question does make this seem, as I think the amicus brief from the states, written by the Utah solicitor general, says that this case is before the Court, as the brief says, ""partly because of a confusion in nomenclature."" And then that amicus brief also says ""although mislabeled a community caretaking warrant exception, the First Circuit effectively applied Brigham City's emergency aid standard."" And I'm wondering if we're just here because of a a confusion about labeling, as that brief says. Can you respond to that?

2378,20-157,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3793.68,3823.045," Good morning, Mr. Desisto. So you told Justice Gorsuch that your best example at common law of something like this was that for the tort of trespass, if you entered property because of necessity, there was no liability. And is it really the case that, say, I'm a neighbor and I go into Mr. Caniglia's home because, you know, I understand the wife is concerned about the presence of the guns still in the house, and I take the guns and then take them back to my house, that I'm not liable either for trespass or conversion?

2379,20-157,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3855.54,3878.88," Okay. And then let's talk about how far this exception might go because, obviously, there's a lot of concern about it being an umbrella for a lot of sorts lots of different things. Let's say that in a town with a high rate of COVID infections, police look through the window and they can see a lot of people gathered together that are not wearing masks. Can they enter?

Counsel, as well meaning as these checks may be, there's always going to be someone who does not want the government's help or doesn't want the intrusion. Normally, when we look at these things under the Fourth Amendment, we do look for some common law historical historic historical analogue, and, here, it seems as though there is none. Could you give us something to look to for the appropriate test? You've given us a number of tests, what you suggest should be the tests, but, normally, we look for some analogue. What would be your best example?
",-0.13100366294384003
2382,20-157,Clarence_Thomas_,4278.14,4297.81," But it seems as though what you just gave me as an as as as analogues would fit under some of our current exceptions, exigent circumstances, emergencies, things of that sort, and I don't know why we would need another category to cover those examples.

And if you use the present words that attach to emergency or exigent circumstances, they might in this situation be too narrow. But suppose we were what would you think, what would the government think, of simply taking this case as a common law case it does involve threats of suicide; they are serious and saying the Rhode Island's legislature has this is a Rhode Island case has has enacted subsequently a statute that we believe has a constitutional standard that allows the officers to take this individual into protective custody if the officer has reason to believe that there's a risk of imminent likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental disability?

How do you define the word ""imminent""?

Maybe what you've said so far does give it some substance.

2387,20-157,Sonia_Sotomayor_,4621.36,4751.045," Counsel, one of the reasons I think the Fourth Amendment was there was to make persons and I'm quoting its own language roughly to secure persons in their home. That's the language of the Fourth Amendment. And it seems to me that I don't have a problem with them having removed this gentleman and taken him to the hospital. That's a seizure, because they had reason to believe that he was threatening suicide. And even though 12 hours had passed, the wife was still concerned, and he admitted to the threat by calling it a joke. I don't think police officers have to take his description at face value given the circumstances described. So seizing him and taking him to the home would seem to me to psychiatric examination as very much an exigent circumstance. Missing here, as I've pointed out to your colleague, is the next step, which is going into the home without attempt to secure consent from the wife and seizing the gun and then keeping it indefinitely until a lawsuit is filed. The wife tried to get it back. He tried to get it back. Weeks and weeks went by. When we permit police to search and seize without some standard, we run the risk of situations like this one repeating themselves. So can you concentrate on the exigency with respect to the second seizure at issue? My colleagues seem concerned with the first one, preventing the suicide, which has to do with seizing the individual or even going in to care for the individual.

And I'd like to start by asking you whether you're concerned that this reliance on a lot of your your answer in a lot of these situations was that, well, that's an exigent circumstance or that's an emergency aid. Why why shouldn't we be concerned that doing that will dilute the limits on those exceptions, as opposed to having a more carefully defined exception for situations that aren't really that exigent or aren't really that much of an emergency?

The only thing we care about is that no court should think it has to be in the it has to be really immediate or in the space of time with which to get a warrant because, after all, a lot of places, there's no place to get a warrant in in in circumstances like these.

Under ACCA, the government has the burden of showing that the increased sentence is warranted, so it has to carry the burden of looking to the least elements approach. But it's different when you're seeking the benefit of removal under the immigration case. There, the person who's seeking has the burden of that benefit is your client, and, therefore, you have the burden of showing the most elements approach for the prior conviction. Why isn't it simply the different burdens under ACCA and the immigration statute that account for the fact that in one case the different burden of going forward? Whether you're seeking a greater sentence or seeking the benefit of removal, why doesn't that simply account for the allocation of the burden of proof? And it's just incidental that in your case, you have a factual question of whether or not subsection (c) was the section of conviction or not?

2404,19-438,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,516.24,557.43500005," All right. So let me give you a very simple way of looking at this case, and you can tell me why this is wrong. Whether or not a person was convicted of a particular crime is a question of fact. There's nothing that prevents if that fact has to be proven, there's nothing that prevents Congress in a civil case like this from saying the burden of proof on that fact is on one party or the other party. And, here, it's placed it on the person seeking cancellation of removal. Is there any obstacle, constitutional obstacle, to Congress doing that?
",0.24875961244106293
2405,19-438,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,608.6,691.105," Well, where did this what what you call the presumption of the least of the acts criminalized come from? It it came from the categorical and modified categorical approaches. They are called categorical because they are making a categorical determination. And take the example of burglary, which has been central to our cases in this area. So you have somebody who's convicted of burglary under, let's say, California law, and the question is whether that is a conviction for generic burglary. It it is a it is a determination about an entire category of cases; that is, all of the cases prosecuted and convicted under the California burglary statute. And it is in that situation where the court asks looks to the least of the acts criminalized. It asks what is the least thing that could get somebody convicted of burglary in California. Would that constitute generic burglary? If the answer to that is no, then it flunks under the categorical test. But what's involved here is not categorical at all. It is the determination of a question of fact, was your client convicted under subsection (c) or was he not convicted under subsection (c)?

2406,19-438,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,722.95,746.425," I mean, as the Chief Justice pointed out, Shepard and Johnson, the cases you rely on very heavily, were criminal prosecutions, where the prosecution, under the Constitution, has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the person was convicted of a particular offense if it wants to impose an enhanced sentence based on that conviction.
",-0.25577524304389954
2407,19-438,Sonia_Sotomayor_,794.935,861.465," Mr. Goldman, I have two different sets of questions. Let me start with the first, which is, assuming we were to disagree with you today and rule against you, would we have any reason to vacate? Are there any other arguments you could make that your client wasn't, in fact, convicted of a CIMT? For example, I read the Eighth Circuit as saying that a sentence of one year or longer fits the sentencing requirement of not being more than one year. Did you challenge that below, that that's wrong? And, secondly, I see the statute here as requiring harm but not necessarily financial harm and not necessarily deception harm, could be emotional harm or even physical harm. And that wouldn't fit a CIMT. Have those arguments been saved below?
",-0.2430586963891983
2408,19-438,Sonia_Sotomayor_,898.11,947.1," Mr. Goldman, can I just stop you because there is one last question I want to ask. I read 1229a(c)(3)(B). In any proceeding under this chapter, any of the following documents or records shall constitute proof of a criminal conviction: an official record of judgment and conviction, which was provided here; an official record of plea, verdict, and sentence, not provided because it wasn't available, and nobody challenges that it was available; and, C, a docket entry from court records that in the in the indicates the existence of the conviction, that was provided. Doesn't that answer the question of whether you've met your burden of proof? You've shown them --
",-0.3210924565792084
2409,19-438,Elena_Kagan_,1010.86,1038.275," Mr. Goldman, I understand that you think it doesn't matter whether the question here is legal or factual, that you win either way. On on the other hand, a lot of the questions that you've been getting would disappear if it were legal because even the government concedes, I believe, that questions of the law are not affected by the burden of proof. So I'm just going to ask you whether you have an argument that this is a legal question?
",-0.2771555781364441
2410,19-438,Elena_Kagan_,1097.965,1132.45," Well, I think what the government would say is that, although the entire inquiry might be a legal one, there's a part of the inquiry which simply involves asking, what crime were you convicted of? And that that's a factual one, even though you then go on to even though you then go on to the more legal inquiry, and even though you decide that question through the use of entirely legal documents. I think that that's what the government would say. So what's the answer to that?
",-0.18067297339439392
2411,19-438,Elena_Kagan_,1174.735,1199.16," Mr. Goldman, a very different question. If you win, would it be permissible for the attorney general to say something like, that was a pretty bad crime, and because it was a pretty bad crime, I won't use my discretion to cancel your removal? In other words, could could the government basically enact the rule that it is arguing for on the back end of the process?
",-0.5951091647148132
2412,19-438,Neil_Gorsuch_,1238.1,1353.045," Counsel, I I guess I'm a little stuck on on the arguments you've made but wondering if there's one that you haven't. To me, it looks like this is probably a factual question about, a contingent set of questions about, what happened in a particular time and place. We're not interpreting any law, any neutral principle, any generally applicable provision. I don't see how Johnson helps because the burden there was on the government in a criminal case. And so I so I'm stuck on a lot of that, and maybe you can unstick me. And the other thing I'm also stuck on, just for what it's worth, is the burden in terms of producing the the evidence of a conviction mentioned in subsection (3) is the burdens on proving the government has while proving deportability, totally different than subsection (4), which is applications for relief from removal or deportability, which then fall on the immigrant. So that that's putting my cards on the table as what I'm stuck on. What I'm what I'm hopeful for or want to explore a little bit is Shepard and why you concede that or, I don't know, maybe you don't that there is that this is all categorical approach. Justice Breyer in, I think it was Nijhawan you can correct my pronunciation, I'm sure said that Shepard, you know, is a the categorical approach in the ACCA context may not always apply in the INA context. And I I would have thought that Mr. Pereida might have argued, forget about the categorical approach, I can I can show on the facts here and my testimony might establish that I wasn't using the Social Security card to obtain benefits or to defraud anybody of anything but simply to get a job, and, therefore, it wasn't a crime of moral turpitude. What about that argument? Should we remand for that? Has that been preserved? Thoughts?
",0.6339836716651917
2413,19-438,Neil_Gorsuch_,1376.52,1391.09," Why why would you why would you have a an immigrant hamstrung by this crazy categorical approach methodology that's nowhere in the statute? Why why should he not be allowed to discharge his burden by by by his testimony?
",0.2611425518989563
2414,19-438,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1460.82,1510.885," Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Goldman. There's no perfect solution as I see it here. There's a situation of uncertainty, and what that means is either some people who should not be eligible for cancellation of removal will remain in the country or some people who should be at least eligible for cancellation of removal will be removed from the country. And I might choose a different policy than Congress did about how to resolve that uncertainty, but Congress put the burden of establishly establishing eligibility for cancellation of removal on the non-citizen. It's kind of a big picture way that is raised by this case. Why is that a wrong way to to think about it?
",0.8613929152488708
2415,19-438,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1565.8,1610.07," And what do you do with the fact that we're not talking about the removal itself technically, but we're talking about cancellation of removal? In other words, you've already the non-citizen's already been deemed usually or at the same time deemed removable. And we're talking about something that would cancel that removable. In that circumstance, it does seem more logical, I suppose, or at least one could understand why Congress made the choice in that circumstance to put the burden on the non-citizen because of the cancellation of removal context. So does the context matter there, or why doesn't it matter?
",0.1629657745361328
2416,19-438,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1842.02,1896.85," Thank you, counsel. An issue that's kind of lurking in the background throughout this case and is certainly affected by the the question of what kind of determination, is it legal or factual, is the limitation to the so-called Shepard documents. You're here from the Department of Justice, so you should know as well as anybody what the experience of the Department has been around the country with that limitation. Is it often the case that those documents or how often are those documents not available? Does it vary from one part of the country to the other? Do you have situations where people are coming forward with documents that seem pretty probative on the question, but they're excluded because they're not Shepard documents? What can you tell me about that?
",-0.20441535115242004
2417,19-438,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1926.51,1956.61," Well, he can know what documents to look for, but the reality, as I understand it, is that often you don't have these things aren't often papered, because you've got a lot of, you know, busy busy criminal dockets and plea bargains and other things like that. So the fact that the lawyer knows what to look for isn't enough. And even if the lawyer finds something probative, that's not going to be admissible on the on the question.
",1.186498999595642
2418,19-438,Clarence_Thomas_,2017.72,2041.78," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Bond, the if I heard Petitioners right, they they don't seem Petitioner doesn't seem to see much deference between the way we would treat this case and the way we would treat it in the criminal context. What's your reaction to that?
",-0.633023202419281
2419,19-438,Clarence_Thomas_,2093.56,2120.975," Just a a matter of curiosity, how much discretion do you have if you think, for example, that a petitioner or an applicant is being evasive, do you does the attorney general have the discretion to to simply dismiss or deny his request for cancellation?
",-1.1110491752624512
2420,19-438,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2199.81,2324.73," Well, there is a virtue in simplicity in the law, and ACCA is complicated enough, much more than anyone thought, as is this. So why isn't the simple thing to do, keeping the law uniform, simple, as much as it can be, if we read Taylor? And when we read Taylor, here's how you decide whether a statute that says, in Section 1342(a), burglary of a car, a house, or a boat, and some are and some are not federal burglary, and which one was this? Was he convicted of a boat burglary or a house? And here's what it says to do: You look at the statute. Well, that doesn't help. They're all three. Then you look at the indictment or information. And then you look at the jury instructions. Now, if those three things, the statute, the jury instructions, and the and the indictment or information, show that this was burglary of a house, that it necessarily, we've said in about 10 cases, is burglary of a house, the government wins. And if they don't, the other side wins. Well, with slightly different words here, slightly different documents do the same thing. Does the statute forbid that? Of course not. The statute that you're talking about has words in it, and those words say that if the evidence indicates one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of relief apply, then the government wins. So we look at the listed documents, we see if they do, and that's the end of the case; if they don't necessarily show that, then he's carried his burden of proof. Whether they show that or not is a question of law. Now why isn't that the end of this case?
",0.10752540081739426
2421,19-438,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2395.3,2420.64999995," He did show. He did show. So that that's my basic point. He did show that he satisfied the applicable eligibility requirement because the applicable eligibility requirement is that set of legal documents in front of the judge does not necessarily show that it was a crime of moral turpitude or burglary in the other case. So he met it.
",0.36369144916534424
2422,19-438,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2488.15,2511.57," will the will the government have necessarily been required will the government have been required to provide certain documents relating to the conviction anyway? If the conviction is the basis for the determination of removability, then I guess the answer to that is yes, but I suppose that's not always so.
",-0.20384284853935242
2423,19-438,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2557.84,2616.2," why do you think that the Shepard limitations would apply in this situation? It's one thing for us to say in a criminal case where the government, the prosecution has the burden of proving prior convictions beyond a reasonable doubt that we are going to put a limit on the proof that the government can rely on to try to discharge that burden. Whether or not that's that was a good idea, that's what was done. But it's something else again to say that where the alien who is seeking cancellation of removal is the one who will be disadvantaged by the failure of proof, that person is limited in by by Shepard in the documents that can be relied on to discharge that burden. What I don't know why why does that make sense? Why is it fair? And where would we get the authority to impose that limitation?
",0.28850963711738586
2424,19-438,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2660.43,2753.05," Counsel, Justice Breyer asked the question basically as I would, which is I read the regulations, they require the alien to put forth those documents in his or her possession. The legal question is, do those documents show that he's been committed he has committed a CIMT? You're asking the opposite question. Do those documents show that he has hasn't committed a CAI CIMT. But the burden of proof is only by a preponderance of the evidence. And if he's provided all of the documents that exist, and no one's arguing I don't think you are, because I think you did a search in this case that any more documents exist, and we have amici that show why they don't tend to exist, at least with respect to low-level misdemeanor charges, why the presumption that the legal presumption, it wasn't a factual presumption; it was a legal presumption that we made in our prior case law why that doesn't get him past the preponderance of the evidence standard? That's a very low standard. It's 51 percent. And if there's ambiguity, what does that have to do with meeting the burden of proof?
",-0.15238922834396362
2425,19-438,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2784.94,2817.67499995," But what you need but what you need is the Shepard documents proving that. And if they don't exist, then you're back to the fact that, as a matter of law, there's no proof that you committed that act, because what you were charged with and what the documents show is the possibility that you might have but not that you did. You have to prove the conviction that you were convicted of CIMT and, in fact, you weren't.
",0.48733192682266235
2426,19-438,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2834.34,2873.78," But the negative but the negative, counsel, is very clear. The negative is, do the records of my conviction show that I was convicted of CIMT? The answer is no, they don't show that. They show that I was convicted legally of a crime that does not fit, that has subdivisions or parts of it that don't fit a CIMT. So that's where I'm having trouble seeing why that's a factual rather than a legal question. What do the documents that exist show?
",0.22956892848014832
2427,19-438,Elena_Kagan_,2937.37,2986.72," So but let's just talk about whether this is a legal or a factual question. You know, you say it's a factual question because you're asking what was he convicted of. But let's take an analogy. And I guess I guess, first, I mean, let's remember how we decide that factual question. We decide it by looking under Shepard to a set of legal documents. So here's my analogy. Let's say this is a contract case, and the question was, what did I agree to? Now, in one sense, that's as much a factual question as this one is. And yet, because we look to the contract, when we look to the contract to determine what I agreed to, we don't think of it as a factual question anymore. We think of it as very much a question of law, we're doing contract interpretation. Why isn't the same thing true here?
",0.26251646876335144
2428,19-438,Elena_Kagan_,2996.93,3050.77," I honestly don't think it has anything to do with that, Mr. Bond. I mean, in the contract, it's it's like it's a factual question, what did I agree to. When we look, because we look to the contract, it and that's a legal document, we treat that question as a question of law. And so too here. The only question I'm talking about now is the preliminary one. What were you convicted of? But, because you look to a set of legal documents, it becomes a question of law. And I'll just add to this, Mr. Bond, that is the way every court in America treats it. Every court of appeals in this country uses a de novo standard in ACCA cases in order to review that determination. And for that matter, the BIA uses a de novo standard to review the IJ's determination. So all of that we would have to throw over if all of a sudden we decided that this was a factual question.
",0.37903711199760437
2429,19-438,Elena_Kagan_,3068.035,3085.185," Okay. Let me let me turn to this let me turn to your broader argument I'm sorry for cutting you off, Mr. Bond. You also don't you you you agree that if this were just a categorical approach case, the burden of proof wouldn't apply, right?
",-0.30002397298812866
2430,19-438,Elena_Kagan_,3108.97,3152," Right. So, if it's just a tool to because a divisible statute is opaque, if it's just a tool, the question is, why should our basic approach change? And the basic approach, which, as somebody else said, you know, has been applied to ACCA and to immigration cases, the basic approach is to say, unless we're certain that the crime you were convicted of has at least the same elements as the generic offense or as the crime of moral turpitude category, unless we're certain, you know, we will not impose the penalty enhancement or impose the unfavorable immigration treatment. So why should that general approach all of a sudden change here?
",0.16837260127067566
2431,19-438,Neil_Gorsuch_,3186.13,3203.005," Mr. Bond, would you agree that a great many misdemeanor crimes across the country have divisible statutes but are not papered in a way to allow anyone to know with any certainty which portion of the statute defendants are convicted of?
",-1.3012434244155884
2432,19-438,Neil_Gorsuch_,3206.125,3258.105," Okay. Let let's just suppose that's the case. It seems to me that if we go down the Shepard road here and say that that immigrants are restricted to certain kinds of proof, that documents that they can use to show their eligibility, in a great many cases where these you just have these divisible misdemeanor statutes, nobody's going to be able to tell, right? So one of two things is going to happen. They all lose, right? And I think that's the position you're asking us to adopt. Or maybe we should allow them to prove by whatever means necessary, including by their sworn statement, whatever credible evidence an IJ would allow, what actually happened. And in this case, for example, that Mr. Pereida wasn't using a Social Security card to defraud anybody of anything but just to get a job. What what do you say to that?
",0.4014310836791992
2433,19-438,Neil_Gorsuch_,3335.1,3349.22," Mr. Bond, you'd agree with me that that he just has to provide facts that support his application, right? And it's up to the IJ to determine whether it's credible and persuasive or perhaps whether further corroborating evidence would be necessary, right?
",-0.9692488312721252
2434,19-438,Neil_Gorsuch_,3372.6,3384.195," All right. So let let let me let me turn to another area entirely, and and that is, do we do we have burdens of proof in in contract interpretation cases? And do they sometimes become questions of fact about what a contract means?
",-1.3307996988296509
2435,19-438,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3414.08,3444.71500005," Thank you. And good afternoon, Mr. Bond. I just want to broaden it out a little bit here and talk about the context. We're talking about eligibility for cancellation of removal, and you want to say that he is categorically ineligible for cancellation of removal. Even if you lose here, the executive branch correct me if I'm wrong could still deny cancellation of removal and remove him, is that correct?
",-0.28165996074676514
2436,19-438,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3448.13,3468.945," Okay. So we're just talking about categorical ineligibility, and, therefore, since you would still have the discretion to deny it, it seems to make sense to think about how this works in practice. And, here, do you consider the facts of this case typical of the cases where this kind of issue arises?
",-0.3920029401779175
2437,19-438,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3496.86,3544.495," Well, I was thinking I was thinking more that he's lived here for 25 years in the United States, has a wife and three kids here, one of whom is a U.S. Citizen, works construction and cleaning, had a fraudulent Social Security number, which got him a $100 fine but no jail time under state law. You know, that seems a thin read to make someone categorically ineligible for cancellation of removal, and the thin read corresponds legally to when you have such that kind of offense, it's not surprising, as Justice Gorsuch says, that the records are going to be thin as well. And I just want to know how we should think about that.

2438,19-438,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3558.02,3584.9," I'm I'm sorry to interrupt, but the special dispensation, you could still deny cancellation of removal. That's the point I started with and wanted to underscore. So it's not taking away the executive branch's ability to deny cancellation of removal if we rule against you. It's just taking away the argument that someone in this situation who's been here for that long with this kind of offense is categorically ineligible.

2439,19-546,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,133.11,177.525," Mr. Huston, I I want to ask you about your your last point. As as you read this statute, the disposition of an FTCA claim bars Bivens claims against the employee. But, of course, the statute speaks of actions, not not claims. And it was was and is very well established that there's no bar with respect to claims in the same action. If if Congress were going to make such a dramatic departure from that rule, the obvious word to use is right there; it's ""claims."" And yet, they they didn't do that.

It would be a a complete bar to any claim that is is raised, as opposed to, you know, any subsequent action. That's where the real departure is. And it seems to me that that's a much more direct way to eliminate any confusion than simply deleting, you know, the ""subsequent"" in that appeared in some some cases.

Now the in this case, Respondent filed the Bivens action together with the FTCA action and though the argument seems to have just disappeared and then reappeared here. Petition Respondent now argues that if if he loses on the on the FTCA claim, that he that he has the alternative argument that since since these were filed together, the outcome should be different from a case in which they were filed separately or sequentially.

2442,19-546,Stephen_G_Breyer_,535.15,603.28," Thank you. Can can you tell me if I have this basically right? Courts of appeals get lots of appeals from district courts. And I thought a judgment is a piece of paper normally that the district judge files at the end of a lawsuit, and it says ""Judgment,"" and it tells you how the lawsuit turned out, who won, and perhaps on what grounds. And, here, the judgment in an action under 1346(b) shall constitute a complete bar. But, normally, if you have four different claims in the lawsuit, the judgment doesn't come in until the whole thing is over. You might preliminarily decide or you decide the judge says this he's going to lose on this claim, he's going to lose on this claim, maybe he'll win on this claim, and, at the very end of the thing, we have a judgment. Isn't that how it works?

We granted cert to decide a particular question which has to do with the effect of a final judgment. Why should we not presume most of the time we answer the question on which we we granted review and not some other question? So that's my question. That that's what I'm asking you.

In your in your view, what is the dividing line between a claim that is not cognizable under 1346(b)(1) and a claim that is cognizable yet fails on the merits?

2446,19-546,Sonia_Sotomayor_,976.625,1051.78," Counsel, I I am a little confused, and perhaps your adversary will un-confuse me, but I don't think every circuit has held that same suit claims of an FTCA and a Bivens claim means that you can't appeal them. I thought at least the Ninth Circuit has said so. All of the other circuits, I agree with you, have said that, if you lose a FTCA claim, you can't file a separate claim. That's not the issue. It's the same claim. But your adversary can tell me what the circuit split is on that question. However, I am going to go back to what Justice Alito raised. You brought the cert petition. I believe that your adversary in its I believe I know in its response, not at length, but it did mention this as an alternative ground not to grant cert, that he could bring the two claims in the same action and not be precluded. And I think the same argument was raised below. Am I correct?

In Section 2672 of the FTCA, it says explicitly: Acceptance of an administrative settlement with the U.S. shall constitute a complete release of any claim against the United States and against the employee of the government. It seems to me that Congress knew how to say that that there was a big difference between a release of a claim rather than a bar to an action. So why should we accept your argument that they meant the same thing when they used different language in two different sections?

2448,19-546,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1153.89,1197.325," All right, counsel, I'm almost out of time, so let me just ask you one last question. As a matter of policy, why would Congress have wanted to go around the common law rule? It seems to me that then happenstance controls. This district court could have ruled the other way, could have said the Bivens claim or, I'm sorry, the Bivens claims like in Mannings, the Bivens claim is good, but the FTCA claim is not. And you're still saying there's a bar, correct?
",0.03205527365207672
2449,19-546,Elena_Kagan_,1241.37999995,1264.945," Count counsel, just a point of clarification first as to the extent of your argument. There are courts in the Seventh and the Tenth Circuit that have said that the judgment bar can undo even prior final judgments on Bivens claims, so sort of retroactively undo a Bivens judgment. Do you think that that's right?
",-1.4548732042312622
2450,19-546,Elena_Kagan_,1299.13,1358.825," I guess I'm wondering whether your understanding of this provision makes it into something that the language suggests it's not. So, if I understand your position correctly, you're really turning this into an election-of-remedies provision; in other words, that once somebody files an FTCA claim, then, really, they they can't bring a Bivens claim anymore. And the only way to bring a Bivens claim is just to forego the FTCA claim. And that might make sense, you know, as a policy matter, to turn this statute into such an election-of-remedies provision, but the statute doesn't read like that. It I mean, Congress knows how to write a provision like that. Instead, this statute reads like a preclusion statute. And preclusion, as the Chief Justice began the argument by saying, always applies between suits and not within a single suit.
",0.239024356007576
2451,19-546,Elena_Kagan_,1389.99,1409.535," All right. But I think I was suggesting, just to just to make myself clear, that's a perfectly sensible statute. I guess my question is, is it the statute that Congress wrote? That Congress wrote a statute I mean, election-of-remedy statutes are easy to write. And this is not that. This is a preclusion statute, which has a different set of consequences.

2452,19-546,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1451.275,1496.64500005," Good morning, Mr. Huston. I just want to follow up on something Justice Alito raised and then Justice Sotomayor followed up on, which is this alternative argument being before us. I mean, we we could decide it, but, as the Court's often said, we're a court of review, not of first view. And there are obviously important exceptions to that principle, but I'm not sure this case really cries out for us to depart from the general principle. So why don't we resolve the question presented that's presented in the cert petition, I think was Justice Alito's question, and that's sufficient unto the day, and we can worry about the other issue when and if we need to address that?
",0.17569485306739807
2453,19-546,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1552.16,1568.045," If we do resolve that question, I'm going to reiterate questions asked by others now, but the key problem for you is it says ""any action,"" not ""any claims."" Do you just want to summarize your best arguments in response to that?
",-0.29556044936180115
2454,19-546,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1617.465,1677.075," Counsel, I want to ask you a question about the question on which we granted cert. Did the government make a mistake in moving moving for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of jurisdiction, as opposed to for judgment on the pleadings or just I I know I know they also moved for summary judgment, but why even have the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction in there? And I'll tell you the reason why I'm asking is it seems to me that 1346(c) gives district courts the jurisdiction to resolve civil actions against the government on the bases that's listed in the statute. And it seems to me that that means that the government is submitting as sovereign to the district court's resolution of those claims either way, whether they win or not, so it's different than, say, in Simmons, where the district court does not have jurisdiction to resolve claims if they involve misconduct in the exercise of a discretionary function. So why did the government even treat this as a jurisdictional issue?
",-0.34452712535858154
2455,19-546,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1763.31,1776.67," before my time expires, let me just clarify something. So you agree that if, say, the plaintiff had not alleged all the elements and so the claim was dismissed without prejudice under 12(b)(6), that wouldn't count as a judgment that would trigger the bar?
",-1.1751571893692017
2456,19-546,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,1977.395,2039.32," Mr. Jaicomo, your theory really would combine the merits and jurisdiction not just in a case like this but in every case. I mean, if you think you have a claim under a federal question statute, if it turns out you don't, then you would say, okay, well, then there wasn't jurisdiction because I didn't satisfy the elements of the statute that gave rise to a federal a federal question. We've we've, I think, long held that in a case like like this one, where, if you make a determination under the merits, there isn't the established jurisdiction against the United States, that they're treated the same. You can't in other words, whenever you lose, you don't lose because the court had under your theory, would have had no jurisdiction. That doesn't seem to make much sense.
",0.7915545105934143
2457,19-546,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2112.56,2129," Well, I guess I don't really understand. I think, under your view, a a a favorable decision for the government would never satisfy the elements of the judgment bar because of the lack of jurisdiction. What what am I missing in that?
",0.1589711457490921
2458,19-546,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2258.495,2311.74," Well, if we did reach this other question, what is your what will you say to what your opposing colleague said? Look, he said, if you read 1346(b)(1), if you read it says the judgment in any action shall constitute a complete bar. Now, to any government claimant against the employee of the government, that's the point of this statute. Go sue the United States; don't sue the employee. But, if you're right, what you could do as a plaintiff is you sue under the statute against the government, you win, and then you go sue against the employee, the very thing that the statute was passed to stop.
",-0.1566409468650818
2459,19-546,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2344.14,2365.35," Well, that's my problem, the disposition of one against the other. So you win against the employer, the government, and then you go sue the employee. Well, I think, if there was one thing this statute was passed to stop, it was that. It was that the United States should take the liability and the employee wouldn't.
",0.20216885209083557
2460,19-546,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2381.98,2407.39," But if you can get Claim 1, we sue the government, give us some money. Claim 2, employee, you're involved in this lawsuit too, give us some money. Okay? Now that's what I'm worried that your argument here would lead to. And from what you said so far, you say that's just what it would lead to, and that's a good thing.

",-1.374531865119934
2462,19-546,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2649.135,2692.515," Counsel, I want to separate out the two arguments, the jurisdictional argument, which was the government's which was the Sixth Circuit's conclusion and the basis of the most of the government's argument. Your alternative argument, I call, the same case argument. Can you Justice Kavanaugh asked this question earlier, and I posed the same one. Given that it is one circuit against others, has there been sufficient percolation before the court below, the Sixth Circuit, for us to jump in and decide this question now?
",-1.2411209344863892
2463,19-546,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2754.325,2817.45," Counsel, I I do have some practical difficulties with the government's position on the same action, meaning that what the government is encouraging plaintiffs to do is to file their Bivens claims first, win or lose, then file their FTCA claims, and and hope that they've won and that we don't put a bar in like the one that Justice Kagan referred to earlier. That seems somewhat time-confuse consuming. It also makes a difference whether a district court decides whether it's going to decide the Bivens claims first and just say, I don't need to decide the FTCA claims, or try both claims together, win both, give judgment on both, and then go on appeal. There seems variations that are very inefficient. Am I right about that?
",0.30946052074432373
2464,19-546,Elena_Kagan_,2859.615,2889.535," Yes, Mr. Jaicomo, just to continue in this same vein, I mean, what the government is saying about this provision, you know, makes sense in a way. I mean, the government is saying this reflects a broad remedial compromise. Plaintiffs can sue the United States, but, in exchange for that, they give up certain remedies against federal employees, and that that's the way we should read the provision. And you can well imagine how Congress might have thought that that would be a good thing to do. So why shouldn't we read the provision that way?

2465,19-546,Elena_Kagan_,2965.09,2989.49," If I understood Mr. Huston's argument, it was that, you know, you might think that we're taking the word ""action"" and making it mean ""claim"" and, in fact, you might think that the two words are different, but, in fact, they're not, because Mr. Huston said an action is just a demand for relief in court, you know, when this statute was written. So why isn't that true?

2466,19-546,Neil_Gorsuch_,3041.2,3069.11," Good morning, counsel. I I'd like to just return to the I guess your alternative argument in the same action simultaneously pending position. What do we do about the fact that your client chose not to pursue his FTCA claim on appeal? And so the judgment there would seem to be in an action and it's final. There doesn't appear to be any simultaneously pending action under the FTCA at this point.

2467,19-546,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3188.69,3259.885," Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Jaicomo. I want to raise the point that's bothering me about what we should decide, and I don't blame you for raising the alternative argument. I understand that. You're trying to win the case. But trying to think about why we should consider it. We obviously discuss very carefully our decisions to grant certiorari on particular cases and particular issues within that case, and we don't usually decide things that weren't decided by the court below. And there are exceptions to that, and no doubt about that, and you but I don't think this is embedded within in the way you said. And sometimes we'll do it if it's really really simple and it will be helpful just to go ahead and resolve it. But I'm not sure this qualifies as really simple either because, if we get to the merits at least not very simple in your direction because, if we get to the merits of that alternative argument, every court of appeals, save one, has ruled against you, and the text says ""any action,"" not any subsequent action. You have forceful arguments in response to that, but I guess I'm just back at why should we consider that issue at this time in this case, given the way it was developed in the Sixth Circuit?
",0.6698461771011353
2468,19-546,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3306.54,3333.9," Well, can I just stop you there? You said the other courts of appeals have ruled against your position on this issue in many different ways, and I don't see how that makes it easier to clear that up. That just means there are lots of routes that courts of appeals have thought that lead to the opposite result from what you're suggesting here. That would seem to make it harder, not easier, for us to just, in your words well, I don't know if you used this phrase, but to clean it up or clear it up, as you said.
",0.48075857758522034
2469,19-546,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3365.96,3386.55," Counsel, I want to make sure that I understand your position on the nature of this judgment and whether it's on the merits or can be a bar. Is it your position I thought I heard you say this earlier; maybe it was in response to the Chief Justice that a judgment is only functions as a bar if it's entered after trial?
",-1.057094693183899
2470,19-546,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3471.45,3492.36," Okay. Let me ask you a question about the second alternative argument that you've made. Let's say that you're you bring a Bivens claim first and you lose, and then you bring an FTCA claim against the United States. Can the United States then just under regular common law preclusion assert defensive issue preclusion against you?
",-1.1037567853927612
2471,20-472,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,128.76,153.8," Mr. Keisler, under your reading, which ""extend"" means to grant, you know, you extend an offer or extend condolences, could an entirely new refinery apply for an extension to it of a hardship hardship exemption? In other words, coming onto the scene for the first time, they would, under your view, I think, have to ask for an extension?
",-1.1975144147872925
2472,20-472,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,293.8,315.92," So this really is a a freestanding exemption, and in your view, and I wonder I'm not saying it's an inconceivable construction, but is this the what you might expect if Congress were going to provide a freestanding exemption, that they would do it in this sort of roundabout way?
",0.02084682136774063
2473,20-472,Clarence_Thomas_,412.36,440.2," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Keisler, the Chief Justice has covered most of the ground I was interested in, but I am interested in this. For you to prevail, would your reading have to be the more normal reading of ""extension"" or simply one of one possible reading of of the word ""extension""?
",-1.085912823677063
2474,20-472,Clarence_Thomas_,471.08,508.2," This seems a little bit odd to think of an extension for something that has already terminated. You know, it's odd, I were to lose if my electricity is turned off because I failed to pay a bill and then I paid it or is that or I get a reprieve, is that an extension, or is that a grace period? It just seems rather odd to read it that way.
",0.7061187624931335
2475,20-472,Stephen_G_Breyer_,666.4,710.56," Good morning. The the other argument that was I believe it's in the lower court and that the Respondents make is Congress had a good reason for making this a single connected exemption. They wanted to phase out the exemptions over time and gradually, if this exemption would end, as it would, or become narrow under their interpretation, it would, there would be fewer and fewer companies that were exempt, and that would mean more and more would have to figure out some way of making do with the program. And that's what they wanted. What's your response?
",-0.39306050539016724
2476,20-472,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,844.24,922.88," Mr. Keisler, you and the and Respondents have different accounts of the purpose of the Act. But it's always difficult to interpret an act in light of its purposes, so because acts serve multiple purposes. So let's put that aside and look at the text. You're right, ""extension"" can mean two different things. It can mean what you think it means. It can mean what Respondents think it means. I don't know whether that's a wash, but both of those are possible. The best textual hook I think you have is the ""at any time"" argument, but there are some other accounts of the role that that's supposed to play and the role that it plays, and I'd appreciate it if you would address those. One is that it meant to it meant to indicate that a party can a small refinery can seek an extension after the the finding that's made on November 30. Why isn't that a plausible explanation of its meaning?
",-0.16524569690227509
2477,20-472,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,983.88,1031.84," Let me come back to the the question you were talking about with the with the Chief Justice, and that is whether a a small refinery that did not get an exemption under (A) could ask for a hardship exemption under (B). How is that possible? Because the first part of (B) says a small refinery may at any time petition the administrator for an extension of the exemption under subparagraph (A). So why doesn't that mean that the refinery must have had one under (A) in order to ask for one under (B)?
",-1.037111759185791
2478,20-472,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,1088.4,1113.84," What do you think is the suppose you're right that the the exemptions don't have to be continuous. What do you think is the standard that the EPA is to apply under (B)? I don't really see any standard. To what is this to what degree is this purely a matter of EPA discretion?
",-1.2681353092193604
2479,20-472,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1156.44,1182.88," Counsel, just for me to be sure or clear, I thought the circuit below disagreed with your interpretation of what ""economic hardship"" means. I thought the circuit below thought that it meant you had to have a particular hardship relating to blending the fuels or buying the credits. Am I wrong about that?
",0.37020736932754517
2480,20-472,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1226.84,1251.72," Now, secondly, you keep speaking about how Congress has acted in other statutes, other relief statutes that it's given at different times. But let's look at this particular one. Is there any use of the word ""extension"" anywhere in this statute elsewhere in this statute that doesn't have a temporal continuity meaning?
",-0.9367970824241638
2481,20-472,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1324.04,1350.36," Well, counsel, I guess my biggest problem is that you say, in context, we should read this differently, and you're talking about the two interpretations, the competing interpretations of what the purpose might be of this statute. But doesn't the use of the word ""temporary"" in the provision at issue suggest the other side's reading more than yours?
",0.05367209017276764
2482,20-472,Sonia_Sotomayor_,1404.92,1433.52," One last question. On your alternative reading, the one that you suggested to the Chief Justice, if we were to accept that ""extension"" is not doesn't require continuity, wouldn't that result in the and I think you acknowledge that small refineries that came into the scene after 2006 could never receive an exemption, correct?
",-1.1062394380569458
2483,20-472,Elena_Kagan_,1478.32,1510.36," Good morning, Mr. Keisler. In in thinking about the ordinary meaning of this word, ""extension,"" I guess I'm I'm wondering if you would comment on on this hypothetical. Suppose that I rented an apartment five years ago and I rented it for a year, and then I decided to give it up, and five years later I'm now really tired of where I'm living now and I want to move back, and I call the landlord and say: I'd like an extension of my lease. What what would the landlord say?
",-0.2598456144332886
2484,20-472,Elena_Kagan_,1546.28,1587.64," Well, Mr. Keisler, I mean, let's think about it in this particular context. So there's a small refinery and and let's say that its initial exemption ended in 2011, and since then, it's been able to meet its renewable fuel obligations and, indeed, continues to do so for for decades. And then, in the year, you know, 2040, 30 years later, it runs into problems and it it files a hardship petition. And you are saying that in this context it's anymore an ordinary use of the word ""extension"" to say that after that 30-year lapse, the small refinery gets its extent its extension?
",-0.25484222173690796
2485,20-472,Elena_Kagan_,1644.88,1659.44," your purpose argument, but I wouldn't think that that's a problem with the text. I mean, 2013, now it's 2016, that's not an extension. It's a resumption or a renewal or a something else, but it doesn't seem really like an extension.
",0.23013290762901306
2486,20-472,Elena_Kagan_,1678.92,1736.48," Well, thinking about that ""at any time"" language, Mr. Keisler and and Justice Alito talked about this too and, you know, of course, that seems very general language, but, if you look at this provision, it's it, you know, essentially says, look, you can get your extension by way of this study or then, even if you're not identified in this study, you can petition for an extension at any time and and you can do that even after the EPA determines the upcoming year's obligations, and you can do it even after a compliance year, so even after the year goes through and and you haven't met it and you're kind of asking for a backwards extension. So that's a lot of ""at any time"" to give meaning to that to that phrase without distorting the word ""extension,"" without distorting the meaning of the word ""extension,"" isn't it?
",-0.21867528557777405
2487,20-472,Neil_Gorsuch_,1810.6,1855.88," Good morning, Mr. Keisler. You acknowledge in your briefs that extensions under (A)(ii)(II) are likely to be continuous during that first period of time, during the first five-year period, but you you suggest that there it is at least possible that they might not be, that there could be discontinuity there too, which would strengthen your argument that there could be discontinuity under (B). I I just want to explore that argument a little bit further. It's Footnote 6 of your reply brief. How do we know that the definition of small refineries would be applied and measured for each calendar year during that first five-year period rather than only once when the initial exemption was required?
",-0.7129841446876526
2488,20-472,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,1954.72,2024.16," Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Keisler. I want to explore with you the relevance, as others have mentioned, of the ""at any time"" language and just get your sense of how that works here. I guess what you're saying is the word ""extension"" under your temporal extension argument could be read in one of two ways. It could be read to require continuous, it could be read to require to not require continuous to get the temporal extension, and that we have to look at other clues in the text of the statute before we get to the purposes, and I'll get to that, but before we get to the purposes, we look at other clues in the text, and ""at any time"" is your hook. Justice Kagan and others have pointed out that you don't necessarily have to read it that way, and I just want to get your kind of full understanding of how ""at any"" ""any time"" works here. And are there any other textual clues that would tell us whether to read ""extension"" as continuous or not requiring continuous?
",-0.7237011194229126
2489,20-472,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2139.36,2155.04," And I understand your argument today to be focusing much more on the second argument in your brief, the temporal extension, than the first argument in your brief, which I think is probably wise. I understand why you did it in your brief, but is that correct? Do you think that's that second argument's actually a stronger argument for you?
",-0.8385635614395142
2490,20-472,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2181.28,2207.44," Then I want to just focus on how the separation-of-powers angle fits in with the real-world effects of how this program works. Under the other side's reading, Congress has eliminated the possibility of an exemption if a small refinery ever in a particular year didn't get it. Under your view, it's not automatic that you get the exemption, right? It's up to EPA, is that correct?
",-0.30226850509643555
2491,20-472,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,2213.12,2236.6," Okay. And then how does it and I understand your further point to be if if a small refinery is having significant economic hardship in a particular year, the question is, did Congress want this is more of a purpose argument but did Congress want EPA to be able to give an exemption in that year, or did Congress want the small refineries to go out of business? Is that a fair way of putting your argument there?
",-0.9363495707511902
2492,20-472,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2297.44,2312.76," Mr. Keisler, do you think that a refinery's request for an extension has to have anything to do with the reasons why it received a prior exemption? In other words, even if there's not a required continuity of time, that there would be some sort of continuity of reason for the exemption?
",-1.414244294166565
2493,20-472,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2379.64,2419.8," Justice Kagan gave you an example in which she posited seeking an exemption in the year 2030, you know, that this could this ""at any time"" language could be stretched pretty far. But, you know, under (B), it relates back to this in (A), the 2008 study that the EPA is supposed to conduct to determine whether compliance would create a disproportionate economic hardship on small refineries. If there's no continuity-of-time requirement, it seems that the temporal connection between that 2008 study and what might happen in 2015, 2020, 2030 gets pretty severed so that there's no connection. Can you say what role the 2008 study would play in your view?
",-0.2025824636220932
2494,20-472,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,2480,2505.6," Let me shift gears and see if there's another provision in the statute that might help you. Section 7545(o)(7)(A) allows the EPA to waive the RFP requirements upon a finding that they would severely harm the economy of a state or region. I could imagine a small refinery, you know, if it if it were struggling or if it were going to be forced out of business, that that might harm the economy of a region.

2495,20-472,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2743.44,2783.88," Mr. Michel, this is a hypothetical-rich case, everyone's different scenarios where ""extend"" or ""extension"" is used in different ways. You know, if you miss a deadline for a term paper, it would be normal language for you to go into the professor and ask for an extension. You wouldn't go in and ask for a new deadline. Given all those hypotheticals, both along those lines and the other way, you're not arguing that this term is plain or unambiguous, right? The terms you used in your opening was straightforward and ordinary, but it's it's it's not plain or unambiguous, is it?
",0.4638935625553131
2496,20-472,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2893.36,2918.04," I want to get back to a point Justice Kavanaugh made that the debate here is about whether or not the small refinery can get in the door. In other words, it doesn't automatically get an extension; it just authorizes EPA to grant an extension. And why wouldn't that be something that suggests a broad meaning of the availability of an extension?
",-0.5495702624320984
2497,20-472,Clarence_Thomas_,2952.24,3007.32," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Michel, just a couple of brief questions. The Secretary let's say it it going back to a point that Justice Kavanaugh made that EPA could often or was often late in in completing its work or and, here, I'm particularly interested in the study that it was required to have done by the end of 2011 or the beginning of 2011. What if it were late and the temporary exemptions expired and then it implemented the rule, let's say, a it it provided for the extensions a month later? Would those be considered extensions or would we or renewal? And and how would you deal with those?
",-1.2425181865692139
2498,20-472,Clarence_Thomas_,3061.8,3082.76," In your definitions that you provide for ""extend"" in your in your brief, they seem to assume words like ""continuance"" or ""continuation,"" which seem to suggest that at some point there was a a termination or an interruption and then a resumption. Do you have any that preclude continuity that that assume continuity?
",-1.31907320022583
2499,20-472,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3155.92,3222.28," I think it is. And they sell the rights to pollute more or to, you know, use less ethanol in the marketplace. As I read it, it's a classical such program. Characteristic of such program compared to a tax is, with a tax, you know the price, but you don't know the amount. Marketable rights, you know the amount, but you don't know the price. I think anybody would have knowledgeable would have thought that from what I've read here. And so no one would know if we go out two or three years which small refineries will find hardship and which won't, and it'll change from year to year or two years to two years, and it would be, to me, a very peculiar statute which gave rights in such a way that when it changes, as it will change all the time, in and out, in and out, in and out, and they don't know who they're giving it go and they don't know when they'll qualify and they might qualify at time A and time B, and so, from the point of view of a marketable rights program, your interpretation seems to turn it into a kind of chaos. Now what do you say?
",0.9599972367286682
2500,20-472,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3232.12,3264.6," That wouldn't help. It wouldn't help, you know, because six years out the price of getting the marketable right goes up 30 percent, and now a whole new set of refineries qualify, or it goes down 50 percent, and then those the ones who have been getting it are out because they're not in hardship anymore. I mean, that's normally the way such a program works. Maybe it didn't work that way here, but you're the one who would know, which is why I bring it up.
",1.2348734140396118
2501,20-472,Stephen_G_Breyer_,3292,3352.32," Why is that roundabout? As you read it I understand how you read it but it seems to me paragraph (A)(i) could be read as follows: Temporary exemption, the requirements of paragraph (2) shall not apply to small refineries that's the exemption until calendar year 2011. That's the temporary. Okay? And now we go down to the next one, and it says the the where there's economic hardship, the what will happen is requirements in paragraph well, there's a study, and then it says that the the exemption under clause (i), two more years. The exemption was paragraph (2) didn't apply. And then it says later the exemption of paragraph (A) will apply where there's disproportionate hardship. I mean, I don't have a problem reading it that way. You could read it many ways, but that seems reasonable?
",-0.20515991747379303
2502,20-472,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,3415.8,3446.68," All right. Well, tell me why the scheme then that you're proposing is one that Congress would think is sensible. If a small refiner is able to comply for a number of years but then is unable to comply because of the fluctuation of the price, why and but would be able to comply again after that year, why would that why would Congress want that small refinery to be forced out of business?
",-0.4108673632144928
2503,20-472,Elena_Kagan_,3753.24,3798.04," Mr. Michel, in thinking of your conversation with Justice Breyer, I mean, it strikes me that there are two possible ways to conceive of the congressional purpose here. And one is Mr. Keisler's way, which is that it was is supposed to be a safety valve, it's supposed to allow small refineries that are having difficulty in any given year, it might be this year, it might be 10 years from now, to have a way out. And the alternative story is the one that you just suggested, which is that this is really conduct-forcing. It's supposed to be that refineries change their methods of proceeding and get into compliance at some point. So how do we choose between those two different ways of understanding what Congress's purpose is?
",-0.1531970053911209
2504,20-472,Neil_Gorsuch_,3878.12,3914.6," Good morning, Mr. Michel. I'd I'd like to address with you the point I I discussed with Mr. Keisler about Footnote 6 in his reply brief and whether there's a continuity requirement in (A) which might shed some light on whether we think there's a continuity requirement in (B). Is he correct that it would be possible would have been possible for a small refinery to receive an initial two-year exemption or extension exemptions in 2008, fall out of lose that exemption in 2010 but then regain it in 2011?
",-1.0904408693313599
2505,20-472,Neil_Gorsuch_,3978.76,3998.72," No, no, no, just interpreting it the way they did, the fact that we're looking at different years, at least doesn't that at least open the possibility that there might be people falling in and out of the small refinery definition even under the period covered by (A) and, therefore, you might have at least conceptually it was possible for there to be some discontinuity?
",0.10856501758098602
2506,20-472,Neil_Gorsuch_,4011.08,4028.84," All right. And then just to return to a couple questions that the Chief Justice asked and that I'm curious about. You if I understood you correctly, you you're arguing that the ordinary meaning of the structure and the purpose here support your position, but you're not arguing that the text is unambiguous?
",-0.5335177183151245
2507,20-472,Neil_Gorsuch_,4062.28,4082.44," So so part of the reason why you think it would be inappropriate is because it it's just a a preamble, but you also indicate, even if it were applicable, you you you you would disavow Chevron deference in this case because you've indicated in a press release you don't intend to continue to enforce the the 2014 regulation?
",-0.4516405165195465
2508,20-472,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,4136.84,4284.56," Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Michel. Mr. Keisler's second argument in his brief, which is his lead argument today, the argument that the extension, the word ""extension"" is temporal but does not have to be continuous, just to set up how I'm thinking about this and then get your response, you know, you you admit it's not an unambiguous word. I think Congress uses ""extension"" sometimes even when something's lapsed. We have the examples COVID and other examples. You make a big deal about ordinary usage, but I'll give you three instances in my life where ordinary usage goes the other way from what you what you say. So sometimes one that you're teaching and you have a 5:00 p.m. due date for a paper, you know, after the due date, you will get an e-mail entitled Extension Request, you grant a paper extension afterwards. Or when a you use a sports contract example in your brief, but oftentimes, if the contract ends at the end of the season, in the off-season, the player signs a new contract. That will be described by most people as player extends for two more years. Or, if you let your print newspaper subscription lapse for a time and then you start it up again, you'll tell your family member or friend, oh, I extended the paper subscription. So I I think ordinary usage also, like congressional usage, in my experience at least doesn't tell us exactly. So how do we break this? And the two things he emphasizes are ""at any time"" and that that's there's no sunset date. So I want to get your responses to that. And then also on the purpose and context, if we get to that, to help break what I don't want to say tie, but to figure out what Congress was thinking about with the word or what it was doing with the word ""extension,"" your position is that Congress wanted small fine refineries to have no outlet at all, to essentially go out of business, whereas the other side's position is simply that EPA would have authority, as a matter of separation of powers, authority to grant an exemption if a small refinery had had a had a problem, and it really seems quite implausible to think Congress wanted refineries in that circumstance to go out of business. So, if I can get your response on the ""at any time,"" no sunset date, and the implausibility of Congress wanting small refineries to go out of business rather than EPA having authority.

2509,20-472,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4389.64,4423.6," Good morning, Mr. Michel. I want to make sure I have a handle on what you mean by ""ambiguous."" You said a couple times that the word ""extension"" is ambiguous, and and I would have thought that by that, you mean that it does have several definitions which we've gone over during argument and in the briefs, if you look in a dictionary, but that in the context of this statute, it's clear which of those definitions or reasonably clear that there's a better indication of which of those definitions is the right one. Am I understanding your argument correctly?
",-0.5087843537330627
2510,20-472,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4436.36,4450.96," Well, I mean, not necessarily unambiguously correct, because, you know, we're here arguing back and forth about what it might mean. But I don't think you mean to say that we could not glean which way in which Congress was using the word ""extension"" when we look at the context, correct?
",0.1918071061372757
2511,20-472,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4454.52,4472.36," Okay. And as for Congress not plausibly intending to send the small refineries out of business, is it possible that Congress just didn't anticipate that they wouldn't be able to comply, that it just grossly underestimated how easy it would be for small refineries to meet the standards?
",0.2994879484176636
2512,20-472,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,4504.16,4525.72," Well, but they say that they're then at the mercy of the RIN market and it can be very extensive. But putting that aside, let's just posit that, you know, what Justice Kavanaugh was saying is right, that your reading would drive some small refineries out of the market. Which way should that cut? I mean, because, if we think that Congress might not have anticipated that at the time, what are we to make of that?
",0.10046841204166412
2513,20-472,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,4710.56,4739.4," Well, I mean, let's say that the period is due to expire on, you know, January 3, and on January 4, the representative of the refinery comes into EPA and said: Here's my application for an extension. Sorry I'm late. Everybody had Is EPA going to give him an extension so that, for example, the period would or wouldn't be continuous?
",-0.8387346863746643
2514,20-472,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,4764.56,4779.28," Well, I don't know why that gives the other side all they need. I mean, right? I mean, what you could say they can get an extension if they ask for it half you know, half a year later, right?
",0.05280217528343201
2515,20-472,Stephen_G_Breyer_,4958.24,5038.88," Same question about marketable rights. I mean, when you read about the first two extensions first extension, it doesn't say 2011 and then two more years. It says 2011 and at least two more years. They could have given 50 more years as far as that wording is concerned. And I guess they wouldn't want to do that because things change all the time. You don't know what the price of the RIN will be. No one knows. Sometimes it's up; sometimes it's down. Now I've just given you an excellent reason why you would lose, because they want small refineries to not have to do this. And who is a small refinery with disproportionate hardship varies tremendously, possibly, across the years. So what do you point to to show I'm wrong? What do you point to in the legislative history? What do you point to in the context in which this was enacted that says no, they're not worried about the fluctuating prices and changes; they're worried only on phasing this out? That's your point. What's your strongest evidence? And I do look at the legislative history, if you have some there.

2517,20-472,Sonia_Sotomayor_,5201.56,5243.24," Counsel, both you and I think the government have said that, as the system has turned out, Congress may not have known that the costs were recoverable. Can you explain that? I mean, what what is odd about this statute is that there are all sorts of jump-off points away from the statute. The government mentioned a bunch of them. Justice Barrett mentioned one in particular, the regional effect. But there are all sorts of other outs that the EPA can implement, but why would Congress not have anticipated the cost recovery?

2518,20-472,Elena_Kagan_,5330.96,5354.64," Mr. Morrison, I want to go back to your conversation with the Chief Justice about what ""at any time"" means. You said it was quite capacious, but, of course, you don't think it goes so far as to give Mr. Keisler what he wants. So could you explain to me what that term means? What what does it include and where does it stop?
",-0.9894120693206787
2519,20-472,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,5501.12,5544.28," Right, the economic harm as distinct from the volume into the market, I'll let Mr. Keisler respond to that if there is a response on rebuttal. Another question picking up on Justice Breyer's questions, it seems like we have a choice whether to interpret this as giving the agency flexibility to give the exemption or kind of a prohibition on granting the exemption. You know, why why, when faced with this kind of provision that doesn't have the kind of sunset language that you would often see, wouldn't we interpret this scheme, to the extent there's ambiguity, to give the agency flexibility whether to grant exemptions given the hardships that could result?
",-0.17483638226985931
2520,20-472,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5615.36,5632.88," Mr. Morrison, I have a question about the word ""temporary."" So it's part of your argument that in context, there's a continuity requirement to the word ""exemption,"" but so long as they are continuous, can these exemptions go on into perpetuity?
",-1.2353705167770386
2521,20-472,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,5680.88,5711.52," Well, if it's not really temporary, however, in the sense that you know, you're you're saying that for practical reasons maybe they would phase out, but, as you read the text, as I understand your argument in any event, as you read the text, there's nothing in the text that stops a small refinery from continually getting the exemption year after year. So it seems to me if ""temporary"" doesn't really mean temporary, then maybe it doesn't cast as much light as you say on what ""exemption"" means either.

What percentage, if you know, of the individuals of whom it is you know, there's a preliminary thing, does this person have a reasonable fear that he will be persecuted or tortured or whatever if he's removed to country X? So think of the group of of where that is held by the ALJ or the administrative the immigration judge. That is held to be a reason. He has a reasonable fear. Then they go on to decide whether that fear is, in fact, correct, to make a finding on that.

So, with 10 percent who will never leave the United States, can we say that it is administratively final? I mean, with 10 percent of these people, they will not leave the United States.

2528,19-897,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,690.26,730.715," Good morning, Mr. Suri. I have a couple of questions about statements that you make in your reply brief. You say that the statute makes detention mandatory during the removal period only for terrorists and criminal aliens. So the two questions are these: First, does that mean that the Department of Homeland Security releases other aliens under supervision? And, second, is there a process for deciding which of these aliens will be detained and which which aliens will be released?
",-1.7615724802017212
2529,19-897,Sonia_Sotomayor_,873.97,956.16," Now 1231(a) commands that the agency release immigrants remove immigrants within 90 days. You seem to have admitted to Justice Breyer that that, in most cases, is impossible for this class of alien. Now, if that is true, we have to pick between two provisions, 1221 1226 and 1231(a), and determine which controls the question of whether these aliens can be released on bond or bail or supervision. Why should we not adhere to the basic interpretive principle that counsels in favor of a harmonious reading and against choosing an interpretation that produces a substantial effect that is inconsistent with the text of another provision? If we accept your reading, basically, we're saying for this class of withholding-only withholding applicants, that they're never going to be removed within 90 days of the finality of their removal order. That just doesn't make any sense to me.

2530,19-897,Elena_Kagan_,1043.655,1076.935," Mr. Suri, if I could take you back to your colloquy with the Chief Justice. You were answering his question on the assumption that there was no third country that was available. But I even want to take it a little bit further and ask you, suppose you had a third country that, for whatever reason, was willing to accept an alien. If if if that alien was currently in withholding proceed proceedings, you couldn't put him on a plane to that third country, could you?
",-0.3261556923389435
2531,19-897,Elena_Kagan_,1082.42,1097.7," So that's what it would depend on, right? That that you would have to provide him notice, and if he had a fear of persecution or torture in that country, he would be given an opportunity to contest his removal to that country. Isn't that right?
",0.09262127429246902
2532,19-897,Elena_Kagan_,1113.31,1133.475," Okay. And that's not as a practical matter. That really is, as as you put it, in the eyes of the law. In the eyes of the law, you cannot put one of these aliens on a plane to any place, either the either the country that's referenced in the removal order or any other country, isn't that right?

2533,19-897,Elena_Kagan_,1158.635,1194.245," Okay. Let me ask you you know, suppose there's an alien who just concedes removability and then seeks withholding relief. And the the the IJ enters the order of removability, of of removal, and and grants withholding. And then that's appealed by the government. Would would that alien be treated as if he were in 1226 or as if he were under 1231?

2534,19-897,Elena_Kagan_,1220.32,1240.09," I I guess the reason I ask is because that seems very similar to me, is that you have a final order of removal and a pending withholding decision, and yet you're going to treat that alien under 1226 but the aliens here under 1231.

Your argument, as I understand it, is, under 1231, that there is a final order of removal dating back to the original order of removal. But, for purposes of 1252, the question becomes, is there some chance for judicial review of of the withholding-only proceedings? And and and that that statute also grants review only of the final order of removal. Judge Richardson acknowledged this difficulty in his dissent in the Fourth Circuit and said that means that there's effectively going to be no judicial review of withholding-only proceedings. But the government apparently in the Fourth Circuit thought that there could be. And, here, on 12 and 13, I I I I see the government, forgive me, as maybe hedging its bets and and and and not really taking a position on this. And and my my question for you is, which is it? Is there review or not? And what do we do about the fact that 1252 uses the same very similar language as 1231, a final order of removal? Surely, a final order of removal can't mean one thing for in one statute and another in another. That would that would seem unlikely at least. So perhaps you can help me with that difficulty.

2540,19-897,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,1688.13,1771.42," And let me ask you this: In your response to Justice Sotomayor, you said that 85 percent of noncitizens in this category remain restrained after the removal period ends. And I'm wondering why the default isn't set to release with supervision. And and here's my reasoning: As I look at the statute, the removal period itself is 90 days. But, if it's the alien's fault that the government is not able to remove the alien during this 90 days and I'm looking at the period the provision in (a)(1)(C), which says, if the alien fails or refuses to make timely application for travel documents, et cetera, that removal period, as defined in the statute, let's say it might be 200 days. But then I'm looking at (a)(3), which talks about supervision after the 90-day period and says, you know, if the alien does not leave or is not removed within the removal period, defined as 90 days in the statute, it says the alien shall be subject to supervision under the regulations. So why isn't the default that, if it's through the fault of the government or no fault of the noncitizen that removal doesn't take place within the removal period, why isn't the default supervision, rather than, as you suggested to Justice Sotomayor, continued confinement?

2541,19-897,John_G_Roberts_Jr_,2077.45,2096.27," what do you do about 1231(a)(5), which says that a reinstated removal order ""is not subject to being reopened or reviewed""? I mean, you're you're taking the position that the withholding-only proceedings prevent that order from becoming final, and yet that would seem to me to be reopening and reviewing it.

2542,19-897,Clarence_Thomas_,2186.415,2209.54," Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Mr. Hughes, I'm a bit confused. Would you so we had a removal order that Respondent was subject to. We agree on that. Respondent returns to the country. Now what happens to that underlying removal order in your assessment?

2543,19-897,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2410.75,2483.71," Why now you you you mean to do you mean to abandon the administratively final? The way I have been reading that is a possibility, though it favors you don't tell tell me I'm wrong right now if I'm wrong, please, because it won't do any good. (5), (a)(5), you know, (5) says reinstatement. So you reinstate an order. The order says, Smith, go. Now we cannot question that order that says, Smith, go. That's what it says in (5). You don't question that. But there are some things you could bring up. You could say: By the way, I'm Jones; I'm not Smith. And now you could also say: By the way, I don't want to go to country X because they're going to murder me, et cetera. And what supports that is the date the order of removal ""becomes."" It doesn't say the date it was reinstated. It doesn't say became final. It says ""becomes final."" And so something must have the possibility of happening between the time you entered the order saying an old order go, Smith, and the beginning of the removal period. Now is that correct?
",0.6899147629737854
2544,19-897,Stephen_G_Breyer_,2487.36,2510.05," All right. If if you make and embrace that argument, I can think of two things that stand between entry order, go, Smith, and the beginning of the removal period, i.e., administratively final: one thing, when you say: Hey, I'm not Smith; I'm Jones. Second thing: I won't don't want to go to country X, they're going to murder me. Are there a third, fourth, and fifth thing?

2545,19-897,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2520.58,2568.465," Mr. Hughes, I want to follow up on the question that Justice Kagan posed to Mr. Suri. Do you agree that while an alien is in withholding-only proceedings, DHS has the authority, the legal authority, to remove the alien to a third country so long as it provides the alien with notice of that third country removal and the alien does not express a fear of persecution or torture with respect to the third country? In in those circumstances, do the statute and regulations authorize DHS to put the alien on a plane leaving the country?
",-1.1959713697433472
2546,19-897,Samuel_A_Alito_Jr_,2678.16,2700.005," Let me ask you let me squeeze in one more question. To what degree is your argument dependent on the statistics that were discussed earlier about the feasibility of removal to a third country? Suppose that there was a third country or third countries that that were willing to accept these aliens. Would you have an argument then?
",-1.2352761030197144
2547,19-897,Sonia_Sotomayor_,2729.43,2747.11," Counsel, how much of your argument depends on your due process concern? As I understood, one of your arguments in your brief is, if we read it the government's way, we're inviting the potential of due process violations. Is that correct?
",-1.4566929340362549
2548,19-897,Elena_Kagan_,2907.545,2936.28," Mr. Hughes, just on the constitutional point again, is is your understanding I guess I'm a little bit confused as to what the government is is saying about Zadvydas and and and how it serves as a backdrop. Is is your understanding that, once six months passes, all of the people in your clients' position will be able to get hearings under Zadvydas?
",-0.5573214888572693
2549,19-897,Elena_Kagan_,3024.09,3046.7," But the government's argument, as it goes through these cases one by one by one is that is that aliens who are in withholding proceedings even after six months do not get Zadvydas hearings because, in that case, detention in that case, removal is still foreseeable?

2550,19-897,Neil_Gorsuch_,3052.41,3077," Good morning, Mr. Hughes. One of the government's main structural arguments in response to your 1226 submission is that Congress placed both the provisions governing restatement of removal orders and provisions governing withholding orders in 1231, not 1226. What what do you say to that?
",-1.4796284437179565
2551,19-897,Neil_Gorsuch_,3102.22,3117.79," I understand that. But, again, both the withholding as well as the reinstatement are in 1231. So you're you're just saying, well, I'm I want to talk about withholding, but that's in 1231 too. So what what do we do about that?
",-0.5673954486846924
2552,19-897,Neil_Gorsuch_,3198.035,3226.855," What do we do about the fact that we don't normally think of agency action becoming final just because a party doesn't press a request for additional agency action? This administrative finality argument all depends on the absence of any request for further agency action from an individual. That seems an unusual way to define ""agency finality."" Can you help me with that?

2553,19-897,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3260.355,3316.06," Thank you. And good morning, Mr. Hughes. Looking at the language of 1226, it of course says pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed. And then when you go to 1231, it makes clear that that decision on whether the alien is to be removed has really already been made automatically in the case of someone who reenters the country illegally, because the prior order of removal is reinstated. So I know we're I'm covering ground that's been covered, but just trying to make sense of the precise text of these two provisions. It gets difficult to say that there's a decision pending on whether the alien is to be removed when the statute itself says they are to be removed. ""Shall be removed"" is the language of 1231. Can you help me on that?
",-0.5098673701286316
2554,19-897,Brett_M_Kavanaugh_,3409.3,3450.97," Yeah. And the '96 Act, as as we discuss often, was of course meant to be very stringent, so it's not surprising that the language of (a)(5)'s worded that way. One of your main responses, and you were talking about this with Justice Kagan, is going past the the six-month Zadvydas period. I guess my question is why don't there are there are cases pending in this Court on that question, the constitutional Zadvydas due process point. Isn't that the better way to analyze this, rather than reconfiguring the statute to get to that result?
",-0.018936309963464737
2555,19-897,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3478.77,3539.03," Counsel, when you were answering Justice Kagan's questions and then again when you were answering Justice Gorsuch, you've pointed out that you thought it would be anomalous for those noncitizens who concede removability and litigate only withholding claims to remain within 1226, whereas those who have reinstated orders and litigate withholding-only claims would be treated under 1231. And I just want to make sure that I'm tracking that because the government says the the dividing line here is once a final order of removal has been entered. And in the normal case, you know, the mine run of cases in which withholding claims are litigated, as you point out, those are in the removal proceedings themself. So, under the government's view, it would make sense that those were under 1226, rather than 1231, because in that situation there is no final order of removal. So explain to me what the anomaly is.
",0.010689708404242992
2556,19-897,Amy_Coney_Barrett_,3573.825,3631.605," Okay. And and let me ask you this: So we're comparing here two statutes, 1226 and 1231. And I'm trying to figure out how much of the scheme in 1226 that's advantageous in terms of offering a bond hearing to the noncitizen is regulatory and how much is statutory. Because in your brief on page 7, you say, ""after an initial custody determination by DHS, Congress determined that a noncitizen is entitled to a bond hearing before an IJ."" But, as support for that, you cite a regulation, not a statutory provision. And as far as I can tell, in 1226 itself, the bond hearing looks discretionary because it says that the alien may be released on bond. So why is a bond hearing an entitlement under the statute as opposed to the regulations? And why would it have to be before an IJ, rather than an official from ICE, as a matter of the statute?
